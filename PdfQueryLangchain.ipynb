This set out \\n£22\\xa0billion of in-year pressures. These pressures were not limited to 2024-25, with \\nthe vast majority recurring in future years. \\nCompensation payments for victims of the Post Office Horizon IT and Infected \\nBlood scandals had also not been fully accounted for. The government is providing \\ncompensation to the victims in full averaging £2.3\\xa0billion a year over the forecast \\nperiod.\\nThere has additionally not been a Spending Review since 2021, so departmental \\nbudgets have not been systematically re-planned to account for the recent spike in \\ninflation and other factors that have caused significant cost pressures.\\nPlans set at Spring Budget 2024 were for day-to-day departmental spending to \\nfall from 16.7% of GDP in 2023-24 to 16.0% in 2028-29 and for public sector net \\ninvestment to fall from 2.5% of GDP in 2023-24 to 1.7% in 2028-29. This was in the \\ncontext of declining public service performance and GDP per capita lower than at \\nthe start of the last Parliament.\\nThe government is taking a different approach. Autumn Budget 2024 is:\\n• Putting the public finances on a sustainable path by strengthening the \\nfiscal framework, including announcing new fiscal rules, and taking difficult \\ndecisions on tax, welfare and spending.\\n• Growing day-to-day departmental spending at an average of 2.0% per year in \\nreal terms between 2023-24 and 2029-30 to support public services, including \\nto deliver 40,000 extra elective appointments a week and reduce NHS waiting \\nlists.\\n• Boosting capital investment by over £100\\xa0billion over the next five years, \\nincluding in transport, housing and research and development (R&D), \\nwith a greater focus on value for money and delivery to help unlock long-\\nterm\\xa0growth.\\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has assessed the impact of the \\ngovernment’s decisions. In the OBR’s Economic and Fiscal Outlook, growth is \\nforecast to increase to 2.0% in 2025 before moderating to 1.6% by 2029.\\nPublic sector net investment averages 2.6 % of GDP over the Parliament. The OBR \\njudges that higher investment will add to GDP during the forecast period, and if \\nsustained will increase the size of the economy in the long term.2\\nAutumn Budget 2024Strengthening the fiscal framework\\nTo support economic and fiscal stability, the government is confirming a set of \\nresponsible reforms to the fiscal framework that improve certainty, transparency \\nand accountability. \\nThis includes announcing new fiscal rules:\\n• Stability rule: to move the current budget into balance, so day-to-day \\nspending is met by revenues, and the government will only borrow for \\ninvestment. \\n• Investment rule:  to reduce net financial debt (public sector net financial \\nliabilities) as a proportion of GDP. This rule keeps debt on a sustainable path \\nwhile allowing the step change needed in investment, by capturing not just \\nthe debt that government owes, but also financial assets that are expected to \\ngenerate future returns. \\nThis is the last year that the fiscal rules will target the fifth and final year of the \\nforecast. The rules must be met by 2029-30 at this Budget, and until 2029-30 \\nbecomes the third year of the forecast, at which point both rules will target the \\nthird year of the rolling forecast period. \\nThe OBR confirms that the government is meeting the stability and investment \\nrules. The current budget is in surplus and net financial debt falls as a share of the \\neconomy by 2029-30. Both rules are met early with the current budget in surplus \\nfrom 2027-28 and net financial debt falling by 2027-28. Public sector net debt also \\nfalls as a share of the economy by 2029-30. \\nThe fiscal rules are set out in a new Charter for Budget Responsibility, which \\nimplements a more stable and transparent framework. This includes committing \\nto one major fiscal event a year, more regular Spending Reviews, and improved \\nsharing of departmental spending information with the OBR.\\nFixing the foundations \\nThe government is driving efficiencies and reducing wasteful spending.  The \\nBudget sets a 2% productivity, efficiencies and savings target for government \\ndepartments and has formally launched the Office for Value for Money to realise \\nbenefits from every pound of public spending.\\nThe government will shortly appoint a Covid Corruption Commissioner. They will \\nlead work to recover public funds from companies that took unfair advantage of \\ngovernment schemes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nThe government is reforming its approach to welfare, including setting a new \\nwelfare cap for 2029-30 with strengthened accountability, to support spending \\ncontrol and ensure that welfare spending is sustainable in the medium term.\\nFraud and error in the welfare system costs the government almost £10\\xa0billion a \\nyear. The government is cracking down on this with a package of measures saving \\n£4.3\\xa0billion in 2029-30. The government will set out reforms to health and disability \\nbenefits early in 2025 to ensure the system supports people who can work to \\nremain in or start employment, in a way that is fair and fiscally sustainable.\\nThe government is ensuring that tax that is owed is paid by introducing the most \\nambitious ever package to close the tax gap, raising £6.5\\xa0billion in additional tax \\nrevenue per year by 2029-30.3\\nAutumn Budget 2024Supporting people with the cost of living\\nThe government is boosting wages for the low paid by accepting the \\nrecommendations of the Low Pay Commission in full, meaning the National \\nLiving Wage will increase. This represents an increase of over £1,400 to the annual \\nearnings of a full-time worker on the National Living Wage and is expected to \\nbenefit over 3\\xa0million low paid workers across the UK. \\nTo protect vulnerable people, the government will provide £1\\xa0billion, including \\nBarnett, to extend the Household Support Fund and Discretionary Housing \\nPayments in 2025-26, which will be used by local authorities to address immediate \\nhardship and crisis.\\nThe government will maintain the State Pension Triple Lock for the duration of this \\nParliament. The basic and new State Pension will increase by 4.1% in 2025-26, in line \\nwith earnings growth, meaning over 12\\xa0million pensioners will receive up to £470 \\nper year.  Working age benefits will be uprated in full in 2025-26 by the September \\n2024 Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate of 1.7%.\\nThe government is also creating a new Fair Repayment Rate, which caps debt \\nrepayments made in Universal Credit, allowing 1.2\\xa0million households to keep more \\nof their Universal Credit award. The Carer’s Allowance weekly earnings limit will also \\nbe raised to improve financial security for carers to support them into work or to \\nwork more hours if they choose.\\nProtecting working people\\nDespite challenging fiscal circumstances and the need to raise additional revenue \\nto repair the public finances, the government is protecting working people.\\nThe government has committed to not increase taxes on working people, which is \\nwhy it is not increasing the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, National \\nInsurance contributions (NICs) or VAT.\\nThe government is freezing fuel duty and extending the temporary 5p cut for \\none year, at a cost of £3\\xa0billion next year, to support hard-working families and \\nbusinesses. This will save the average car driver £59 in 2025-26.\\nThe government will not extend the freeze to income tax and National Insurance \\ncontributions thresholds. From April 2028, these personal tax thresholds will be \\nuprated in line with inflation.\\nSupporting businesses\\nThe government will deliver a fairer business rates system through permanently \\nlower business rates multipliers for retail, hospitality and leisure (RHL) properties \\nfrom 2026-27. The Budget also provides £1.9\\xa0billion of support to small businesses \\nand the high street in 2025-26 by freezing the small business multiplier and \\nproviding 40% relief on bills for RHL properties, up to a £110,000 cash cap.\\nTo recognise the economic and cultural importance of British pubs, and \\ncommitment to supporting smaller brewers, the government is cutting alcohol \\nduty on draught products from February next year, reducing it by 1 penny per \\naverage strength pint. Alcohol duty on non-draught products will increase in line \\nwith Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation from the same date.4\\nAutumn Budget 2024The government is supporting spirits producers, such as the Scotch Whisky \\nindustry, by removing mandatory duty stamps for spirits and increasing investment \\nin the Spirit Drinks Verification Scheme, which allows producers to verify the \\ngeographic origin of their products. \\nThe government is providing stability and predictability to support businesses \\nto invest by publishing a Corporate Tax Roadmap, which confirms that the \\ngovernment will cap the rate of Corporation Tax at 25%, the lowest in the G7, for the \\nduration of the Parliament.\\nRaising revenue to fund public services\\nTo repair the public finances and help raise the revenue required to increase \\nfunding for public services, the government is taking the difficult decision \\nto increase the rate of employer NICs by 1.2 percentage points to 15%. The \\nper-employee threshold at which employers start to pay National Insurance will \\nbe reduced from £9,100 per year to £5,000 per year. These changes will apply from \\n6\\xa0April 2025. \\nTo support small businesses with these changes, the government is increasing \\nthe Employment Allowance from £5,000 to £10,500 and removing the £100,000 \\nthreshold, expanding this to all eligible employers. This means that 865,000 \\nemployers will pay no NICs next\\xa0year. \\nThe Budget increases the lower rate of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) from 10% to 18% \\nand the higher rate from 20% to 24%. This ensures asset owners pay their fair share \\nwhilst keeping the UK tax system internationally competitive, with lower rates \\nthan comparable EU countries. CGT rates for Business Asset Disposal Relief and \\nInvestors’ Relief will rise gradually to 14% from 6 April 2025 and match the main \\nlower rate of 18% from 6 April 2026, to allow business owners time to adjust to \\nthe\\xa0changes. \\nThe government is making the inheritance tax system fairer by applying \\ninheritance tax to unspent pensions pots and restricting the generosity of \\nagricultural property relief and business property relief for the wealthiest estates. \\nTo ensure Air Passenger Duty (APD) revenues remain sustainable, the government \\nwill adjust all APD rates in 2026-27, adding £2 for those flying economy to short-\\nhaul destinations. Higher rates for private jets will increase by 50% and the \\ngovernment is consulting on extending the higher rate to include more private jets. \\nTo help drive the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) the government is \\nstrengthening incentives to purchase EVs by widening the differentials in Vehicle \\nExcise Duty First Year Rates between EVs and hybrids or internal combustion \\nengine cars. The government is also maintaining EV incentives in the Company Car \\nTax regime and extending 100% First Year Allowances for zero emission cars and \\nEV\\xa0chargepoints for a further year.\\nDelivering on tax commitments\\nThe government is delivering on its commitments to make the tax system fairer \\nand raise revenue to fund public services.\\nThe Budget is closing loopholes in the tax system, including ending the unfair \\ncurrent treatment of carried interest and replacing the non-dom tax regime with a \\nnew residence-based system to make sure that everyone who makes their home in \\nthe UK pays their taxes here. 5\\nAutumn Budget 2024The government is supporting first-time and main home buyers by increasing the \\nHigher Rates for Additional Dwellings in Stamp Duty Land Tax on the purchases \\nof second homes, buy-to-let residential properties, and companies purchasing \\nresidential property, from 3% to 5% from 31 October 2024. \\nTo help make the UK a clean energy superpower, oil and gas companies will \\ncontribute more to support the energy transition. The government is increasing \\nthe rate of the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) from 35% to 38%, removing the 29% \\ninvestment allowance, and extending the levy until 31 March 2030. To provide \\ncertainty and to support a stable energy transition, 100% first-year allowances in the \\nEPL will remain and the government will consult in early 2025 on how the oil and \\ngas tax regime should respond to price shocks once the EPL ends in 2030. \\nTo help fund the government’s priorities for education and young people it is \\ndelivering on its commitment to charge VAT on private school fees and to remove \\nbusiness rates charitable relief in England. \\nFixing the NHS and reforming public services\\nThrough Phase 1 of Spending Review 2025 the government is resetting public \\nspending for 2024-25 and setting departmental budgets for 2025-26. \\nThe government is providing an additional £22.6\\xa0billion of resource spending in \\n2025-26, compared to 2023-24 outturn, for the Department of Health and Social \\nCare. This will support the NHS in England to deliver an additional 40,000 elective \\nappointments a week and make progress towards the commitment that patients \\nshould expect to wait no longer than 18 weeks from referral to consultant-led \\ntreatment. \\nThe government is boosting capital investment in public services in 2025-26 \\nincluding £1.5\\xa0billion to deliver capacity for more than 30,000 NHS procedures, \\nover 1.25\\xa0million more diagnostic tests and new beds across the NHS estate, and \\n£1\\xa0billion to reduce the backlog of critical NHS maintenance, repairs and upgrades. \\nThe government is also investing £1.4\\xa0billion to help rebuild schools, £1.2\\xa0billion to \\ndeliver extra prison places, and almost £1.6\\xa0billion in local roads maintenance.\\nThe government is delivering on its other first steps, including supporting \\nrecruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England through a £2.3\\xa0billion increase \\nto the core schools budget, launching Great British Energy and a new Border \\nSecurity Command, and cracking down on antisocial behaviour by supporting \\nneighbourhood policing. \\nThe Budget fixes the envelope for Phase 2 of the Spending Review, which will \\ndeliver a new mission-led, technology-enabled, and reform-driven settlement for \\npublic services. The Spending Review will conclude in late spring 2025. \\nRebuilding Britain\\nThe government is delivering its growth mission by prioritising stability, investment \\nand reform to drive prosperity across the UK. The Budget takes the difficult \\ndecisions to put the public finances on a sustainable path to create the conditions \\nfor growth. \\nSupported by the new fiscal framework, the Budget increases public investment \\nby more than £100\\xa0billion over the next five years to boost growth and help crowd \\nin private investment in the long run. Capital investment will increase by £13\\xa0billion \\nnext year, taking total departmental capital spending to £131\\xa0billion in 2025-26.6\\nAutumn Budget 2024This includes investing in transport, kickstarting the delivery of 1.5\\xa0million homes, \\nsupporting new industries and job creation, and protecting record R&D funding. \\nThe Budget also increases investment in public services, recognising that a well-\\nfunctioning NHS and education system are critical to the economy.\\nWith new guardrails that will govern the approach to capital spending, and new \\nand strengthened institutions, the government is reforming the way it plans, \\nassures, delivers and evaluates capital spending. These changes will provide greater \\ncertainty for departments, investors and supply chains, and greater assurance that \\ninvestment achieves value for money, is well delivered and supports growth. \\nThe government will work in partnership with the private sector to further increase \\ninvestment. The government has created the National Wealth Fund to catalyse \\nover £70\\xa0billion of private investment, set out plans for a modern Industrial Strategy \\nto support investment in growth-driving sectors, and launched a pensions review \\nto unlock greater investment in UK growth assets.\\nThe government is making the reforms needed to deliver sustained growth in the \\nlong-term. These include ambitious planning reforms to remove barriers to growth, \\nthe development of a 10-year infrastructure strategy to be published alongside \\nPhase 2 of the Spending Review, the forthcoming publication of the Get Britain \\nWorking White Paper, and the establishment of Skills England to ensure we have \\nthe highly-trained workforce needed to deliver economic growth.\\nThe government’s growth policy priorities, under the framework of stability, \\ninvestment and reform, have been structured into seven pillars, as illustrated in \\nchapter 3. These priorities are being taken forward in partnership with business, \\nand backed by a continuous focus on delivery supported by a Growth Delivery Unit \\nestablished in HM Treasury. \\nAutumn Budget 2024 is fixing the foundations of the economy and beginning a \\ndecade of national renewal. The government is protecting working people, fixing \\nthe NHS, and boosting investment to deliver growth and prosperity for all parts of \\nthe country.Autumn Budget 20249\\nAutumn Budget 20241Economic and fiscal \\ncontext\\nSummary\\n1.1 Since 2010, the UK economy has experienced low productivity growth, rising \\ndebt levels, and declining public service performance. In July, the government \\npublished an audit of public spending which set out £22 billion of in-year spending \\npressures, the vast majority of which are recurring costs.1\\n1.2 The government is fixing the foundations by supporting economic and fiscal \\nstability, boosting investment, increasing spending on public services, and setting \\nthe public finances on a sustainable path. These are essential foundations for long-\\nrun economic growth.\\n1.3 The government is announcing robust fiscal rules, which the independent \\nOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR) confirms the government is on track to \\nmeet:\\n• Stability rule: to move the current budget into balance so that day-to-day \\nspending is met by revenues.\\n• Investment rule:  to reduce net financial debt as a share of the economy. \\n1.4 To support economic stability and underpin the commitment to fiscal \\nresponsibility, the government is confirming a set of responsible reforms to the \\nfiscal framework that improve certainty, transparency and accountability. The \\ngovernment is publishing a new Charter for Budget Responsibility and ‘A\\xa0strong \\nfiscal framework’, setting out the detail of the fiscal rules and these wider \\nchanges.2,3 \\n1.5 The Budget completes Phase 1 of Spending Review 2025, which resets \\ndepartmental budgets for 2024-25 and sets budgets for 2025-26. Phase 1 focuses \\non stabilising and supporting public services and delivers a real terms increase in \\ndepartmental spending of 4.3% per year on average over 2024-25 and 2025-26. \\n1.6 The Spending Review (SR) now moves to Phase 2, which will conclude in late \\nspring 2025. Phase 2 will take a mission-led, reform-driven, technology-enabled \\napproach to funding public services while investing in long-term growth. To \\nmobilise private investment, and achieve higher long-run growth, and start to \\nrebuild Britain, the government is announcing over £100 billion of additional capital \\ninvestment over the next five years.4\\n1 Fixing the Foundations: public spending audit 2024-25 , HM Treasury, August 2024. Details of numerical references, \\nincluding National Statistics, used in this chapter can be found in ‘Autumn Budget 2024 data sources’.\\n2 ‘Charter for Budget Responsibility’, HM Treasury, October 2024.\\n3 ‘A Strong Fiscal Framework: Explaining the government’s new fiscal framework and rules’, HM Treasury, \\nOctober\\xa02024.\\n4 This is based on a comparison with Spring Budget 2024 capital spending plans to 2028-29 and the forecast pre-\\nmeasures assumption that capital spending rises with nominal GDP in 2029-30.10\\nAutumn Budget 20241.7 The economy is expected to continue its recovery from a recession in 2023 \\nand weak performance since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Growth is set to \\nincrease to 2.0% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026, before settling close to its trend rate in \\nthe later years of the forecast. The OBR judges that this Budget will, if sustained, \\npermanently increase the size of the economy in the long term.\\nFiscal and economic context\\nFiscal context\\n1.8 Economic and fiscal instability creates uncertainty for households, businesses, \\nand markets. UK economic policy uncertainty has been higher than the global \\nmeasure in recent years.5 Over the same period, the public finances deteriorated, \\nand debt increased.

The slowdown in productivity growth in the \\ndecade following the GFC has been observed across advanced economies, but \\nit has been particularly sharp in the UK. In the decade prior to the GFC, the UK’s \\naverage productivity growth rate exceeded that of Germany and France, and \\nwas only slightly lower than that of the US. The UK’s average rate of productivity \\ngrowth in the decade after the financial crisis (0.6%), was slower than in France \\n(0.9%), Germany (1.2%), and the US (0.9%).15\\nThe productivity slowdown can be decomposed into three components: capital \\ndeepening (growth in the capital stock, both private and public, available \\nto workers), labour composition (characteristics of those employed, such as \\nindustry, age, and education), and Total Factor Productivity (TFP – a measure of \\nthe efficiency with which labour and capital are combined in the production \\nprocess). Slower growth in capital deepening has played a larger role in the UK’s \\nslowdown compared to other countries.16\\nBusiness investment, a key component of capital deepening, has been \\nparticularly weak in the UK relative to other countries over the past few decades. \\nSince Q2 2010, real business investment in the UK has averaged 9.6% of GDP, the \\nlowest level in the G7.17 There are several factors that may have accounted for \\nthis, but it is likely that elevated levels of economic policy uncertainty in recent \\nyears have been a major contributor (Box 1.B) and public investment has been \\nlow historically with frequent changes to planned spending.\\n1.14 The UK’s lower productivity growth compared to Germany and the US in the \\ndecade following the GFC has increased existing sizeable productivity gaps to these \\ncountries.18 The benefits of closing these productivity gaps are significant. If the UK \\nwere as productive as Germany, GDP per capita would be around £8,000 higher in \\ntoday’s prices. If it reached US levels, it would be around £9,000 higher.19 \\n1.15 The UK economy has many enduring strengths. It has high-quality research \\ninstitutions, many innovative firms, a recognised set of strong institutions for \\nregulation and competition, a pro-entrepreneurial environment, a highly skilled \\nworkforce, and investment opportunities across the country. Coupled with its \\nstatus as a global trading nation with comparative advantage in high-value sectors \\nacross services and manufacturing, these strengths mean the UK can close the gap \\non peer nations. However, policy uncertainty has held back growth. \\n1.16 Employment growth, previously a strong positive contributor to GDP \\ngrowth, has stalled since the start of the pandemic. Weak employment growth \\nhas reflected an increase in the rate of economic inactivity. The UK is the only \\ncountry in the G7 to not have returned to pre-pandemic levels.20 The working-age \\ninactivity rate has increased steadily from 20.8% in 2019 Q4 to 22.2% in 2024 Q2, \\n15 HMT calculations based on OECD Productivity Database .\\n16 Cracking the Productivity Code: An international comparison of UK productivity , Van Reenen, J., and Yang, X., \\nJune 2024.\\n17 HM Treasury calculations based on published data from national statistics agencies.\\n18 HM Treasury calculations based on OECD Productivity Database .\\n19 HM Treasury calculations based on ONS and OECD data: UK GDP per head at current market prices in 2023 (ONS \\nIHXT) uplifted by the percentage difference in UK and Germany/US output per hour worked (OECD Productivity \\nlevels, US dollars per hour PPP converted, current prices).\\n20 OECD Infra-annual labour statistics. The UK economic inactivity rate is 1.4 percentage points higher than before \\nthe pandemic (2024 Q2 vs 2019 Q4), making it the only G7 economy where the inactivity rate has not returned to \\npre-pandemic levels.14\\nAutumn Budget 2024largely accounted for by a rise in inactivity due to ill-health.21 Long-term sickness \\nrelated inactivity has risen to a record high of 2.8 million people in 2024. Reducing \\neconomic inactivity will be essential to reaching the government’s ambition of an \\n80% employment rate. \\n1.17 Looking ahead, several trends will fundamentally reshape the UK and global \\neconomy. Technological advancements, shifts in global trade, the transition to a \\nlow-carbon economy, and demographic change all present opportunities and \\nrisks. Adapting to these trends is key to securing sustainable growth and improving \\nliving standards. \\nDelivering economic stability\\n1.18 The UK economy has faced unprecedented shocks, including the pandemic \\nand Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, which contributed to the largest increase \\nin inflation in almost 50 years. The policy response shaped the economic effect \\nof these shocks. External shocks have been exacerbated by UK-specific factors, \\nresulting in elevated levels of domestic policy uncertainty that have far outstripped \\nglobal trends. This is why the government is taking action to restore stability, to \\nprotect working people and create the necessary conditions for investment and \\ngrowth. Box 1.B sets out in more detail the importance of a stable macroeconomic \\nenvironment. \\nBox 1.B Macroeconomic stability and growth\\nMacroeconomic and policy stability influences economic growth directly and \\nindirectly.\\n• Economic stability provides certainty for firms and households to plan \\nspending and investment. Households may respond to certainty by \\nincreasing consumption and reducing precautionary saving.22 Firms may \\naccelerate or increase investment due to the increased predictability of \\nfuture returns, driving capital accumulation and productivity.23,24,25\\n• Stable public finances and a robust fiscal framework can support growth by \\navoiding crises, helping to anchor inflation expectations, lowering borrowing \\ncosts, and protecting investment.26\\n• Clear and well-executed policy encourages investors by giving confidence \\nabout the role the public sector will play in supporting growth.27\\n21 Summary of Labour Market Statistics , Office for National Statistics, October 2024.\\n22 ‘Precautionary Saving and the Marginal Propensity to Consume’, Kimball, July 1990.\\n23 ‘Investment under Uncertainty’, Dixit & Pindcyk, 1994.\\n24 ‘The Impact of Uncertainty Shocks’, Bloom, 2009., Econometrica, Vol. 77, No. 3, 623–685.\\n25 ‘Uncertainty Shocks in a Model of Effective Demand’, Basu, & Bundick, 2017., Econometrica, Vol.85, No.3, 937-958.\\n26 The Economic Impact of Fiscal Policy Uncertainty: Evidence from a New Cross-Country Database , IMF Working \\nPapers, September 2024.\\n27 OECD Economic Surveys: United Kingdom , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \\nSeptember 2024.15\\nAutumn Budget 2024Measures of uncertainty, such as the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, \\nhave been elevated globally in recent years (Chart 1.3).28  UK policy uncertainty \\nhas been higher than global policy uncertainty for most of the past 15 years. \\nThere was a noticeable spike around the time of the referendum on the \\nUK‘s membership of the European Union in 2016.

The \\ngovernment is supporting low and stable inflation by reducing borrowing year on \\nyear after 2024 -25. New remit letters for the Financial Policy Committee, Prudential \\nRegulation Committee, Financial Conduct Authority, and Payment Systems \\nRegulator will also be published alongside Mansion House. \\nA strong fiscal framework\\n1.21 The government’s objective for fiscal policy is to support sustainable economic \\ngrowth and\\xa0the provision of high-quality public services and investment\\xa0across \\nthe UK, through the effective management of the public finances and sustainable \\ntaxes and borrowing. At Autumn Budget 2024 the government is publishing a \\nnew Charter for Budget Responsibility, implementing its reforms to the fiscal \\nframework to strengthen the public finances and improve transparency.\\n1.22 The government is announcing its fiscal rules:\\n• Stability rule:  to move the current budget into balance, so that day-to-day \\nspending is met by revenues.\\n• Investment rule:  to reduce net financial debt as a share of the economy. \\nStability rule\\n1.23 The stability rule (which is the government’s fiscal mandate) requires that the \\ncurrent budget must be in surplus in 2029-30, until 2029-30 becomes the third \\nyear of the forecast period. From that point, the current budget must then remain \\nin balance or in surplus from the third year of the rolling forecast period, where \\nbalance is defined as a range: in surplus, or in deficit of no more than 0.5% of GDP. \\nThis range will support the government’s commitment to a single fiscal event \\nevery year by avoiding the need for policy adjustment at forecasts outside of fiscal \\nevents. If the range is used between fiscal events, the current budget must return \\nto surplus from the third year at the following fiscal event. \\n1.24 The current budget excludes borrowing for capital investment, measuring \\nthe difference between current receipts and all other expenditure. Balancing \\nthe current budget means that the government’s day-to-day spending is met \\nby revenues and so ensures that, over the medium term, borrowing is only for \\ninvestment. This means future generations will not be burdened with the costs \\nof public services today. The transition to targeting the third year of the forecast \\nwill provide a strong anchor for fiscal sustainability, while providing the necessary \\nflexibility to respond to macroeconomic shocks. \\nInvestment rule\\n1.25 The government is increasing investment in the economy to support growth, \\nwhile ensuring debt is on a sustainable trajectory. 17\\nAutumn Budget 20241.26 The government’s fiscal mandate is supplemented by a target to ensure \\ndebt, defined as public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL or net financial debt \\nfor short), is falling as a share of the economy by 2029-30, until 2029-30 becomes \\nthe third year of the forecast period.29 Debt should then fall by the third year of the \\nrolling forecast period.  \\nBox 1.C What is net financial debt?\\nNet financial debt, defined as public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL), is \\nan official statistic that has been published by the Office for National Statistics \\nsince 2016, based on international statistical guidance.\\nNet financial debt includes all the debt and assets counted within PSND \\nbut is a broader and more comprehensive measure.30 In addition to the \\ngovernment’s stock of debt captured in PSND, it includes all other financial \\nliabilities (including funded pensions obligations and standardised guarantees). \\nIn addition to the liquid assets (like cash and deposits) captured in PSND, it also \\nrecognises illiquid financial assets (such as equity holdings and loans), which \\nare netted off the debt held to calculate the overall measure of the public sector \\nbalance sheet.31 Net financial debt does not include non-financial assets like \\nschool and hospital buildings.\\nCompared to PSND, in 2023-24 net financial debt included an additional £1,058 \\nbillion of financial assets, principally loan and equity assets,\\xa0and an additional \\n£667 billion of liabilities, principally around £507 billion worth of funded public \\nsector pensions liabilities.32\\nPublic sector net borrowing (PSNB) is one of the best-understood flow \\nmeasures of the surplus or deficit of the public finances. One simple way to \\nthink of net financial debt is as the stock measure that corresponds to the flow \\nof PSNB.\\nThe path for net financial debt has broadly tracked PSND over time. This is \\nbecause the assets and liabilities captured in PSND make up the majority of \\nthose included in net financial debt. Year-on-year changes to both measures are \\nprimarily driven by PSNB. Further detail is set out in ‘A strong fiscal framework’.33\\n1.27 Targeting net financial debt allows the government to deliver a step change in \\ninvestment spending, while maintaining a strong fiscal anchor. Net financial debt:\\n• Strengthens fiscal management by providing a fuller account of what \\ngovernment owes and owns. The Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that net \\nfinancial debt provides a ‘more complete picture of the government’s financial \\nposition, while removing some of the perverse incentives associated with a \\nnarrow focus on PSND’.34\\n29 Autumn statement: Supplementary fiscal aggregates , Office for National Statistics, November 2016.\\n30 Public sector net debt (PSND) includes government debt liabilities for currency and deposits, debt securities and \\nloans. It is presented net of assets treated as ‘liquid’ in UK public finance statistics.\\n31 As defined by international guidance: European System of Accounts  and The System of National Accounts ..\\n32 Public Sector Finances , Office for National Statistics, October 2024.\\n33 ‘A Strong Fiscal Framework: Explaining the government’s new fiscal framework and rules’, HM Treasury, October \\n2024.\\n34 Fiscal rules and investment in the upcoming Budget , Institute for Fiscal Studies, September 2024.18\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Recognises the value of financial assets. Unlike PSND, net financial debt \\nreflects that financial investments, like loans, have a positive value. Not \\nrecognising the value of government’s financial assets could overly constrain \\npublic investment.\\n• Enables investments in financial assets, such as those delivered by the National \\nWealth Fund, that are expected to grow the economy while delivering a \\npositive return for the Exchequer. Using a debt metric that does not recognise \\nfinancial assets creates an incentive for government to forgo profitable \\ninvestments. Where investments make a return above the government’s cost \\nof finance they lower (not increase) the debt burden.\\n1.28 Before the measures announced in Autumn Budget 2024, the OBR forecast \\nthat the margin against net financial debt falling as a share of GDP in 2029-30 \\nwould be £8.7 billion higher than for PSND, and £20.9 billion higher than PSND \\nexcluding the Bank of England (PSND ex BoE).35 This gap has narrowed relative \\nto the OBR’s March 2024 forecast, when it had been £37.1 billion and £53.0 billion \\nin the fifth year respectively. This reflects changes by the OBR to the forecast \\nmethodology for net financial debt to capture the effects of asset purchase facility \\n(APF) sales and redemption losses, as well as other changes to the underlying pre-\\nmeasures forecast for both metrics. The change is detailed in the OBR’s October \\n2024 Economic and Fiscal Outlook.\\nA reformed fiscal framework for stability and transparency\\n1.29 The government is reforming the fiscal framework to support stability \\nby creating a predictable fiscal policy-making environment and to increase \\ntransparency. Robust guardrails will ensure investments are consistent with fiscal \\nsustainability and decisions represent value for money. Box 1.D provides details on \\nthe new framework. \\nBox 1.D The strong fiscal framework\\nThe improvements to the fiscal framework are set out in ‘A strong fiscal \\nframework’36 and include:\\n• New guiding fiscal principles to move towards only borrowing for \\ninvestment, and to keep debt on a sustainable path.\\n• The new stability and investment rules, which implement these principles.\\n• A move away from five-year targets, which have been widely criticised for \\nenabling continual delays to fiscal consolidation.37,38\\n• Improvements to fiscal management by monitoring a wide range of \\nmetrics.\\n• A commitment to hold one major fiscal event per year to give families and \\nbusinesses stability and certainty on upcoming tax and spending changes.\\n35 In the OBR October 2024 forecast, figures presented as a % of GDP (for both outturn and forecast) are based on \\nthe vintage of nominal GDP data that was available when the OBR closed the pre-measure forecast, so do not \\nreflect upward revisions in the latest Quarterly National Accounts published on 30 September.\\n36 ‘A strong fiscal framework: Explaining the government’s new fiscal rules and framework’, HM Treasury, October \\n2024.\\n37 Strengthening the UK’s fiscal framework , Institute for Government, February 2024.\\n38 How do the parties’ policy proposals fit in with their fiscal rules? , Institute for Fiscal Studies, June 2024.19\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Committing to hold a Spending Review every two years, setting \\ndepartmental budgets for a minimum of three years.

These are set out \\nin the Financial Transaction Control Framework.41 The core principles are that:\\n• The established spending control framework in Managing Public Money \\nand Consolidated Budgeting Guidance remains in full. 42,43\\n• New financial transactions (FTs) should generate a return at a portfolio level \\nthat at least covers their cost of financing, or when they do not, the costs of \\nloss-making investments will be transparently recognised in departmental \\nbudgets.\\n• All large-scale FTs and guarantees should be delivered by expert institutions \\nincluding the National Wealth Fund, UK Export Finance, and the British \\nBusiness Bank.\\n• The government will publish an annual report on its financial assets using \\nasset values audited by the National Audit Office (NAO).\\n• Standardised risk controls for FTs and guarantees will be introduced.\\n1.30 The government is reforming how it plans, assures, delivers, and evaluates \\ncapital spending and will underpin these reforms with new and strengthened \\ninstitutions. These changes will provide greater certainty and greater assurance \\nthat investment is high-quality and well delivered, including by:\\n• Publishing a 10-year infrastructure strategy alongside Phase 2 of the Spending \\nReview, outlining the government’s long-term approach.\\n39 United Kingdom: 2024 Article IV Consultation , International Monetary Fund, July 2024.\\n40 Budget Responsibility Act 2024 , UK General Public Acts, September 2024.\\n41 ‘Financial Transactions Control Framework’, HM Treasury, October 2024.\\n42 Managing Public Money , HM Treasury, May 2012.\\n43 Consolidated Budget Guidance , HM Treasury, March 2023.20\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Setting five-year capital budgets and extending them every two years at \\nregular spending reviews to avoid funding ‘cliff edges’ and give more certainty.\\n• Increasing the transparency of investment decisions by publishing business \\ncases for major projects and programmes.\\n• Establishing the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority \\n(NISTA) to drive more effective delivery of infrastructure across the country. \\nAlongside existing assurance mechanisms, NISTA will have an enhanced role \\nin supporting major projects, including validating business cases prior to HM \\nTreasury funding approval.\\n• Formally launching the Office for Value for Money (OVfM), with the \\nappointment of an independent chair.\\n• Working with the NAO to benefit from their scrutiny of capital projects and \\nlearn lessons which can be applied to future projects.\\nInvesting for growth\\n1.31 Supported by the new fiscal framework, the Budget significantly increases \\npublic investment and helps to crowd in private investment in the longer term. \\nPublic sector net investment will average 2.6% of GDP over the Parliament, in \\ncontrast to the previous government’s plans to reduce PSNI to 1.7% of GDP.

Median of G7 countries excluding the United Kingdom, data \\nup to 2019.22\\nAutumn Budget 2024have severe effects on growth”.45 Under the government’s new spending plans, \\npublic sector net investment will now average 2.5% of GDP over the next five years \\nsupported by £100 billion additional capital investment. \\nBox 1.E How public investment affects potential output\\nThe OBR’s discussion paper ‘Public investment and potential output’ (2024) sets \\nout a framework for accounting for the effects of changes in public investment \\non GDP.46 The OBR identified and modelled two key channels affecting short, \\nmedium, and long-run potential output from a sustained increase in public \\ninvestment: a boost to demand in the economy in the near term that dissipates \\nover time, and a permanent increase in the capital stock and productivity \\nleading to higher potential output within and beyond the five-year forecast \\nhorizon.\\nUsing this framework, the OBR has estimated that the additional public \\ninvestment in Autumn Budget 2024 will directly increase potential output by \\n0.1% after five years and if sustained, three times as much (0.3%) after ten years.\\nThe OBR assumes these potential output effects grow over time, reflecting \\nthe time taken to spend, complete, and operationalise public investment. \\nThis means much of the growth benefit relating to spend within the five-year \\nforecast continues to build up well beyond this horizon. The OBR estimates GDP \\nwould be around 1.1% higher in the long run (50-year horizon) if the increase \\nin public investment announced in Autumn Budget 2024 over and above the \\nprevious government’s plans is maintained.47\\nThe OBR notes that higher public investment could additionally raise returns \\nin the private sector and labour market, resulting in crowding-in effects. \\nCommentary from leading economists has emphasised that additional \\ncrowding-in effects could be significant.48 The OBR expects the crowding-in of \\nprivate investment from the public investment package to increase potential \\noutput by 0.1% after ten years and 0.3% in the long-run. This represents a boost \\nof around a quarter to the already significant direct effect of the additional \\npublic investment. Taken together, the additional public investment, if \\nsustained, is expected to increase GDP by 0.4% after ten years and by 1.4% in the \\nlong run.\\n45 Fiscal Monitor , International Monetary Fund, October 2024.\\n46 OBR, Discussion paper no.5: Public investment and potential output, 2024.\\n47 The long-term impacts assume that public investment remains constant as a share of GDP beyond the forecast \\nperiod.\\n48 Public investment and potential output , National Institute of Economic and Social Research, October 2024: \\nSection: “General equilibrium effects”.23\\nAutumn Budget 2024Source: ‘Economic and Fiscal Outlook’, OBR, October 2024.\\n2025-26\\n2026-27\\n2027-28\\n2028-29\\n2029-30\\n2030-31\\n2031-32\\n2032-33\\n2033-34\\n2034-35\\nLong runEnd of ﬁve-year forecast\\nLong run\\nChange in GDP (Supply impact of public investment)\\nChange in GDP (Crowding in of business investment) % of real GDP difference from baseline\\n0.0%0.2%0.4%0.6%0.8%1.0%1.2%1.4%1.6%Chart 1.5: Long-term impacts of sustained public investment \\nEconomic Outlook\\n1.35 The government’s decisions in Autumn Budget 2024 will boost investment \\nand drive a higher level of output in the long run. The measures in the Budget \\nform part of the wider growth mission, underpinned by seven pillars (outlined in \\nChapter\\xa03). \\nSummary of the Economy Forecast\\n1.36 The OBR forecasts the economy to grow by 1.1% in 2024, before increasing to \\n2.0% and 1.8% in 2025 and 2026. Growth then returns to around the OBR’s estimate \\nof its potential rate, at 1.5%, 1.5% and 1.6% over 2027, 2028 and 2029 respectively. \\nThe OBR judges that policies announced at Autumn Budget 2024 boost output in \\nthe near term and expect the package as a whole to have a net positive effect on \\npotential output beyond the forecast horizon. \\n1.37 The OBR expects annual CPI inflation to remain close to the 2% target \\nthroughout the forecast period. The OBR forecasts inflation to average 2.5% in 2024, \\nbefore increasing to 2.6% in 2025. It is expected to fall towards target across the \\nfinal three years of the OBR forecast. Reflecting the impact of policy on inflation \\nand demand, the OBR has adjusted its assumed path for Bank Rate, resulting in a \\nslower reduction in interest rates over the forecast. 24\\nAutumn Budget 20241.38 The OBR forecasts business investment to reach 10% of GDP in 2029, up from \\n9.7% of GDP in 2023 in the latest GDP statistics. The OBR judges that the Budget \\npackage as a whole will both crowd-in private investment (via increased public \\ninvestment as set out in Box 1.E) and crowd- out private investment, as higher \\ngovernment spending is offset in the short term by lower private sector activity. \\n1.39 The unemployment rate is forecast to average 4.3% in 2024, a small increase \\non 2023, before remaining close to 4.0%. The employment rate (for those aged 16 \\nand over) is expected to remain close to 60% over the forecast. The OBR expects \\npart of the additional costs from the employer NICs rise to be passed through to \\nlower real wages, which would reduce the supply of labour, and partly through to \\nlower profits. \\n1.40 Real household disposable income (RHDI) per capita, a measure of living \\nstandards, is forecast to grow by 1.4% in 2024-25 and 1.1% in 2025-26 and is no longer \\nset to decline in the near term. RHDI per capita increases by 2.1% over the forecast \\nperiod as a whole. RHDI captures only household income net of taxes and benefits \\nand therefore does not reflect the benefits to households of investment in public \\nservices. GDP per capita, an alternative measure of living standards that captures \\nhigher spending on public services, is set to grow more rapidly than RHDI per \\ncapita, rising 5.9% between 2024-25 and 2029-30. \\n1.41 Global developments continue to weigh on the outlook for growth and \\ninflation. Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine and ongoing conflict in the Middle East pose \\nrisks to the UK and global economies. Any material escalation that further disrupts \\nenergy and goods trade could contribute to higher oil prices and increased \\nshipping costs. \\n1.42 Taken together, the measures in Autumn Budget 2024 fix the foundations \\nof the economy and permanently boost economic output in the longer term. \\nSustainable public finances will contribute to a more stable business environment, \\nsupporting businesses and households to make long-term decisions, boosting \\ninvestment and output. While some of the decisions taken at this event affect \\ninflation and output within the five-year forecast, the government has prioritised \\ninvestments that will pay off in the long term. 25\\nAutumn Budget 2024Table 1.1: Overview of the OBR’s economic forecast1\\nOutturn\\n2023Forecast\\n202422025 2026 2027 2028 2029\\nGDP growth\\xa0 0.1 1.1 2.0 1.8 1.5 1.5 1.6\\nGDP growth per capita -0.8 0.2 1.4 1.3 1.0 1.0 1.1\\nPotential output growth 1.3 1.6 1.6 1.5 1.7 1.6 1.7\\nMain components of GDP\\n Household consumption30.3 0.4 1.7 1.9 1.7 1.7 1.7\\n General government consumption 0.5 3.0 4.0 1.6 1.6 1.8 1.8\\n Total fixed investment 2.2 -0.3 -1.7 2.6 2.3 1.5 1.8\\n Business investment 5.5 -0.4 -1.2 0.5 1.2 1.4 1.9\\n General government investment 7.7 2.0 -0.7 6.1 1.1 -1.3 -1.4\\n Private dwellings investment4-7.6 -1.6 -3.3 4.8 5.5 3.8 3.7\\n Change in inventories5-0.9 -0.1 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\\n Exports -0.5 -1.1 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.7\\n Imports -1.5 -0.6 -0.8 0.7 1.1 1.0 1.1\\nConsumer Prices Index (CPI) \\ninflation 7.3 2.5 2.6 2.3 2.1 2.1 2.0\\nEmployment (millions) 33.2 33.1 33.4 33.7 33.9 34.1 34.3\\nUnemployment (% rate) 4.0 4.3 4.1 4.0 4.1 4.1 4.1\\nProductivity – output per hour 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.2 1.1 1.1 1.1\\n1 All figures in this table are rounded to the nearest decimal place.

The current \\nbudget deficit increases this year compared to the OBR March 2024 forecast. The \\ngovernment’s tax reforms and other measures then move the public finances to a \\nposition where day-to-day spending is matched by current receipts, and both net \\nfinancial debt and PSND are falling as a share of the economy. \\nControlling borrowing and day-to-day spending\\n1.44 The current budget deficit is forecast to be £55.5 billion in 2024-25. As shown \\nin Chart 1.6, from 2027-28 the current budget is in surplus, which means the \\ngovernment is only borrowing for investment. At £10.9 billion in 2027-28 it is almost \\ndouble the surplus projected in the OBR’s March 2024 forecast for that year. If \\nachieved, it would be the largest since 2001-02.49 \\n1.45 PSNB peaks at £127.5 billion, 4.5% of GDP, in 2024-25. PSNB then falls to \\n£105.6\\xa0billion, 3.6% of GDP, in 2025-26.

The fiscal stance can be assessed using several \\nborrowing metrics.\\nThe primary deficit (PD), which subtracts net interest costs from borrowing, \\nprovides a measure of the effect of taxation and government expenditure \\non the economy. This is because interest costs are not a useful indicator of \\nhow fiscal policy affects economic activity and prices. The PD is higher in \\n2024 -25 than forecast in March 2024. From 2024-25 the PD falls by an average \\nof 0.5 percentage points of GDP per year over the forecast. The PD falls by \\n2.3\\xa0percentage points of GDP in the three years from 2024-25, reflecting a larger \\nconsolidation effort than forecast in March 2024 over this period, and reaches \\na primary surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2027-28. This helps to reduce inflationary \\npressure and supports the independent MPC in returning inflation sustainably \\nto target. Higher tax revenues contribute two-thirds to the overall reduction in \\nthe primary deficit over the forecast horizon with lower spending accounting for \\none third.\\nAnother measure is the cyclically adjusted primary deficit – this removes the \\nimpact of the economic cycle from the primary deficit. This has been higher \\nthan the PD in recent years, reflecting that demand has been greater than \\nsupply. It also falls over the forecast, with a consistently downward path.\\nSource: Office for National Statistics and Office for Budget Responsibility.Primary deﬁcit Cyclically-adjusted primary deﬁcit2018-19 2019-20 2020-21 2021-22 2022-23 2023-24 2024-25 2025-26 2026-27 2027-28 2028-29 2029-30Forecast\\n-4-20246810121416Chart 1.7: Fiscal Stance\\n% of GDP29\\nAutumn Budget 2024The government is meeting its fiscal rules\\n1.49 The OBR has confirmed that the government is on track to meet its stability \\nrule and investment rule.

There are risks to any forecast, but the government’s \\nrobust fiscal framework is designed to respond to these risks if they materialise and \\nensure fiscal sustainability.\\n1.56 The OBR projects PSND will grow significantly over the next half a century \\nbecause of longer-term pressures such as demographic changes, which are \\nincreasingly important in a number of major economies.54,55 The government’s \\nfocus on economic growth is an essential component of mitigating this long-run \\nrisk and ensuring the public finances remain sustainable.

As a first step, the Chair will advise the \\nChancellor and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on decisions for Phase 2 of the \\nSpending Review. This will include conducting an assessment of where and how \\nto root out waste and inefficiency, undertaking value for money studies in specific \\nhigh-risk areas of cross-departmental spending, and scrutinising investment \\nproposals to ensure they offer value for money.\\n2.5 The OVfM will also develop recommendations for system reform, informed by \\nlessons learned from the past, international best practice, and the views of external \\norganisations. This will underpin a ruthless focus within government on realising \\nbenefits from every pound of public spending.\\n2.6 The government will shortly appoint a Covid Corruption Commissioner. The \\nCommissioner will lead work to recover public funds from companies that took \\nunfair advantage of government schemes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n2.7 The Budget also confirms that the government is progressing the savings \\ncommitments announced as part of the audit of public spending in July:\\n• Action has already been taken to stop all non-essential spending on \\nconsultancy in 2024-25, with an aim to halve spending in future years. The \\ngovernment expects to deliver the £550 million in-year savings target set \\nin July based on HM Treasury forecast figures and planned Departmental \\nexpenditure. The government will continue to bear down on consultancy \\nspending in 2025-26 in line with existing commitments;\\n• The Government Communications Service is expecting to save £85 million  \\nfrom reducing unnecessary communications spend – exceeding the £50 \\nmillion target set out in July; and\\n57 Fixing the Foundations: Public Spending Audit 2024-25 – HM Treasury40\\nAutumn Budget 2024• The government will continue to dispose of surplus estate and can confirm \\nthat it will set a target of at least £1 billion of receipts by 2030.\\n2.8 In Phase 1 of the Spending Review, the government has taken a ruthless \\napproach to prioritising spending and identifying opportunities for savings. \\nExamples of this include:\\n• Taking additional actions since cancelling the Migration and Economic \\nDevelopment Partnership with Rwanda, which are forecast to deliver \\n£2.2\\xa0billion of savings in 2024-25 and 2025-26 by reducing the asylum backlog. \\nCompared to the previous trajectory of spending, this represents a total saving \\nof over £4 billion on asylum across the two years; and\\n• Delivering significant efficiencies across departments, including £107\\xa0million \\nsavings in HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in 2025-26 through continuous \\nimprovement and more than £250 million in the Department for Work and \\nPensions (DWP) in savings and efficiencies in 2025-26, including through its \\nservice modernisation programme.\\n2.9 The government has placed a renewed focus on public sector productivity \\nin Phase 1 of the Spending Review. The government has set departments a 2% \\nproductivity, efficiency and savings target for next year. This will ensure that \\ndepartments are focusing on the delivery of what matters most. The government \\nwill monitor the delivery of this target through the Government Efficiency \\nFramework.\\n2.10 To continue to drive value for money, the government will also use the new \\nProcurement Act to create a simpler and more transparent regime for public sector \\nprocurement that will deliver better value for money and reduce costs for business \\nand the public sector. The government will implement the Act in February 2025 \\nwith further reforms including a new National Procurement Policy Statement.\\n2.11 The government is putting fraud prevention at the heart of public spending \\ndecisions, with the Public Sector Fraud Authority (PSFA) assessing Initial Fraud \\nImpact Assessments (IFIAs) submitted by departments on their highest risk priority \\nprojects. This will make sure that counter-fraud activity is considered in all major \\nspending decisions.\\n2.12 The government is also developing a strategic plan for a more efficient and \\neffective civil service, including through improving skills and harnessing digital \\ntechnology to drive better outcomes for public services.\\nTackling fraud and error in the welfare system\\n2.13 Fraud and error in the welfare system costs the government nearly £10 billion a \\nyear.58 The government is committed to tackling this to fix the public finances and \\ninvest in public services. That is why the government is announcing the biggest \\nwelfare fraud and error budget package in recent history, saving £4.3 billion in \\n2029-30.59\\n2.14 This package includes programmes that will prevent, detect, and correct \\nfraud and error in the benefit system.

The \\nmeasure is being taken forward through the forthcoming Fraud, Error and Debt Bill. \\nClosing the tax gap\\n2.16 Before considering any tax changes to repair the public finances, the \\ngovernment is ensuring that everyone is paying the tax that they owe. This is fair, \\nessential for a well-functioning economy and will help to keep taxes on working \\npeople as low as possible. To stop people taking unfair advantage of the system, the \\ngovernment is announcing the most ambitious ever package to close the tax gap, \\nraising £6.5 billion in additional tax revenue per year by 2029-30. To deliver this and \\nwider reform, the HMRC Board has been refocused with the Exchequer Secretary \\nto the Treasury as its ministerial chair for the first time.\\n2.17 As part of this package, the government is recruiting an additional 5,000 \\ncompliance staff – with the first 200 starting training in November – and providing \\nfunding for 1,800 debt management staff. This will ensure more of the tax that is \\nowed is paid and that more taxpayers pay outstanding tax due.42\\nAutumn Budget 20242.18 The government is also investing in modernising IT and data systems to \\nimprove HMRC’s productivity and improve taxpayers’ experience of dealing \\nwith the tax system, delivering the modern and digital service businesses and \\nindividuals expect.\\n2.19 The government will legislate to close loopholes in company car tax rules by \\nending contrived car ownership schemes, and encourage taxpayers to pay tax on \\ntime by increasing the interest rate charged on overdue tax debts. The government \\nis also committed to taking stronger action on the most egregious tax fraud, \\nincluding by expanding HMRC’s criminal investigation work and legislating to \\nprevent abuse in non-compliant umbrella companies.\\n2.20  The Budget also sets out the first steps of the government’s longer-term \\nambition to design out opportunities for non-compliance and make the tax system \\neasier to deal with, through making better use of data and raising the standards of \\ntax advisers who interact with HMRC.\\nSupporting people with the cost of living\\n2.21 Fixing the foundations will create the necessary conditions for growth, as well \\nas providing the economic stability working people need. The choices made in the \\nBudget also mean that the government will provide support to the people who \\nneed it the most, delivering on its commitments to protect working people, spend \\ntaxpayers’ money more sustainably, and provide a welfare system that supports \\npeople to work, where they can.\\n2.22 Rewarding work with a fair wage is the best way to improve living standards, \\nwhile also providing people with the security of knowing they will be able to pay \\ntheir bills now and in the future. \\n2.23 That is why the government swiftly updated the remit of the Low Pay \\nCommission (LPC) in July to ask them to recommend a National Living Wage \\n(NLW) that, for the first time, takes into account the cost of living.\\n2.24  The government has accepted the recommendations in full and the NLW will \\nincrease by 6.7% to £12.21 per hour from April 2025. This represents an increase of \\n£1,400 to the annual earnings of a full-time worker on the NLW and is expected to \\nbenefit over 3 million low paid workers across the UK.60,61\\n2.25 Over time, the government intends to create a single adult wage rate, and \\ntherefore also asked the LPC to recommend a minimum wage for 18-20 year olds \\nthat would begin to close the gap with the main NLW rate, eventually giving them \\nthe same wage for the same day’s work. In accepting the recommendation from \\nthe LPC, from April 2025, the National Minimum Wage (NMW) for 18-20 year olds \\nwill be £10.00 per hour, an increase of 16.3%, the largest ever increase in both cash \\nand percentage terms. This means a boost to annual earnings of over £2,500 for \\nnearly 200,000 young people across the UK.62,63\\n2.26 The government is also giving carers greater flexibility to work and increase \\ntheir financial security by raising the Carer’s Allowance Weekly Earnings Limit to \\nthe equivalent of 16 hours at the NLW.

Alongside this, the government will also carry out further work on \\nthe earnings limit to explore what more can be done to help support more carers \\ninto work.\\n2.28 The government will accelerate the migration of claimants onto UC from \\nEmployment and Support Allowance (ESA),  bringing the start date forward \\nfrom 2028 to September 2024. This move will\\xa0bring more people into a modern \\nbenefit regime, continuing to ensure they are supported to look for and move into \\nwork.\\xa0Around half of ESA claimants will receive more financial support on UC, while \\nothers will receive transitional protection to ensure nobody is worse off at the point \\nat which they move over to UC.\\n2.29 The government recognises that additional support continues to be needed \\nto improve economic security and resilience for those families who need it most. \\nThe government will provide £1 billion, including Barnett impact, to extend both \\nthe Household Support Fund in England and Discretionary Housing Payments in \\nEngland and Wales in 2025-26. This will be used by local authorities to help low-\\nincome households facing hardship and financial crisis, including supporting them \\nwith the cost of essentials such as food, energy and water.\\n2.30 In addition, the government is helping low-income households on UC by \\nallowing them to pay off their debts over a longer timeframe and keep more of \\ntheir UC each month. The government is creating a new Fair Repayment Rate \\nwhich caps debt repayments made through UC at 15% of the standard allowance. \\nThis will benefit around 1.2 million households as they will keep more of their UC \\naward each month, with households expected to be better off by £420 a year \\non average. Around 700,000 of the poorest families with children will benefit as \\na result of this change, supporting the government’s ambition to tackle child \\npoverty.66\\n2.31 The government will also extend the current Help to Save scheme until April \\n2027. With effect from April 2025, eligibility will be extended to all UC claimants \\nwho are in work. A delivery consultation, including proposals for a reformed and \\nimproved scheme, has been published alongside the Budget.\\n2.32 The government is committed to delivering a welfare system that provides a \\nsafety net for when people need it and supports living standards for those on the \\nlowest incomes. The government will therefore  uprate all working age benefits for \\n2025-26 in full,  by the September 2024 CPI rate of 1.7%. This will provide 5.7 million \\nfamilies on UC with an average annual increase of £150 in 2025-26.67\\n64 Department for Work and Pensions, Carer’s Allowance cases in payment, Stat X-plore, February 2024.\\n65 This is the number of carers who are expected to make a successful new claim to Carer’s Allowance between \\nApril 2025 and March 2030. It has been calculated by inflating forcasted inflows in employment by the proportion \\nof carers falling between the baseline earnings limit and in the increased earning limit (according to the earnings \\ndistribution), and applying a take-up assumption to reflect the likelihood of making a claim.\\n66 Department for Work and Pensions analysis (Ad hoc statistical analyses 2024), Department for Work and \\nPensions, October 2024\\n67 Department for Work and Pensions analysis (Ad hoc statistical analyses 2024), Department for Work \\nand\\xa0Pensions, October 202444\\nAutumn Budget 20242.33 The government will maintain the State Pension Triple Lock for the duration \\nof this parliament.

From April 2028, these personal tax thresholds \\nwill be uprated in line with inflation.\\n2.37 The cost of living remains high, with potential fuel price volatility amid global \\nuncertainty. Therefore, the government will protect motorists by freezing fuel duty  \\nat current levels for one year to support hard-working families and businesses. \\nThe 5p cut will be extended for a further 12 months and the planned increase in \\nline with inflation for 2025-26 will be cancelled. This represents a saving of £59 in \\n2025- 26 for the average car driver.71\\n2.38  The government will also facilitate competition in the road fuels market, \\nimprove transparency and empower drivers to find the cheapest fuel prices \\nby accepting the Competition and Markets Authority’s recommendations to \\nimplement Fuel Finder, an open data scheme for fuel prices and a market \\nmonitoring function by the end of 2025. While fuel price reactions are inevitably \\nuncertain and sensitive to wider global factors, by increasing transparency \\nand encouraging competition between forecourts, scenario modelling by the \\ngovernment suggests pump prices could reduce by 1-6p per litre as a result of \\nthese measures, helping to ensure that drivers get a fair deal for fuel across the \\nUK72.\\n68 Department for Work and Pensions, State Pension Caseload, Stat X-plore, May 2023.\\n69 A new full State Pension will increase from £221.20 a week in 2024-25 to £230.25 a week in 2025-26.

The \\nprevious government had planned for day-to-day departmental spending to fall \\nsignificantly as a proportion of the economy in the coming years. The government \\nis taking a different approach and taking difficult decisions on tax to raise revenue \\nand deliver the increased investment that public services need.\\n2.40  The government is increasing the rate of employer National Insurance \\ncontributions  (NICs) from 13.8% to 15% and reducing the per-employee threshold \\nat which employers become liable to pay National Insurance (the Secondary \\nThreshold) from 6 April 2025 to £5,000.

The \\ncurrent Employment Allowance gives employers with NICs bills of £100,000 or \\nless a discount of £5,000 on their employer NICs bill. The government will protect \\nthe smallest businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance to £10,500 next \\nyear.74 The government will also expand the Employment Allowance by removing \\nthe £100,000 eligibility threshold, to simplify and reform employer NICs so that \\nall eligible employers now benefit. Taken together, this means that 865,000 \\nbusinesses will pay no NICs at all, and more than half of employers with NICs \\nliabilities will either see no change or will gain overall next year.75\\nSupporting businesses and providing stability\\n2.42  In raising revenue to repair the public finances, the government is committed \\nto creating the conditions for economic growth. The UK is forecast to be in the \\nmiddle of the pack in the G7. There is mixed evidence linking a country’s tax-to-\\nGDP ratio and growth performance and there is no causal link between the two.76,77 \\nThe government recognises that a stable and predictable tax system is essential for \\nlong-term growth and is taking steps to restore stability whilst supporting the high \\nstreet and small businesses.\\n2.43  The government is committed to supporting small businesses and the high \\nstreet, by taking the following action:\\n• Transforming business rates in England over this Parliament to deliver a fairer \\nsystem that protects the high street, better incentivises investment, and is \\nfit for the 21st century. To meet the first of these objectives, the government \\nintends to introduce permanently lower business rates multipliers for high-\\nstreet retail, hospitality and leisure properties (RHL) from 2026-27. To make sure \\nthis tax cut is fiscally sustainable, the government intends to fund it through \\na higher multiplier for the most valuable properties. This measure will provide \\ncertainty and support for the high street.\\n• Supporting the high street and small businesses in England during the interim \\nperiod – for 2025-26, the small business multiplier  will be frozen.

The Budget is therefore \\nreducing duty on qualifying draught products, which represent approximately \\n60% of alcoholic drinks sold in pubs.78 This measure reduces duty bills by over £85 \\nmillion a year, cutting duty on an average strength pint by a penny. To support \\nsmall producers, the government will make the Small Producer Relief more \\nvaluable. The government will also consult on ways to encourage small brewers to \\nretain and expand their access to UK pubs, maximising drinkers’ choice and local \\neconomies, including through provisions to enable more ‘guest beers’. \\n2.45  The government will always support the UK’s high-quality food and drink \\nproducers and is therefore announcing the end of mandatory duty stamps for \\nspirits, removing an outdated regulatory burden which provided minimal tax \\nassurance. The government will also consult with industry to establish how the \\ngovernment can better support the delivery of the Spirit Drinks Verification \\nScheme, which allows spirit producers to verify the geographic origin of their \\nproducts. This will include the government making an investment of up to 5 million \\nto support and look to reduce bureaucracy for existing and prospective producers \\nwho may wish to join.\\n2.46 To provide stability and predictability for business, the government is \\npublishing the Corporate Tax Roadmap. Central to the Roadmap is a competitive \\nand sustainable main rate of Corporation Tax capped at 25%, which is the lowest in \\nthe G7, as well as a commitment to maintain the UK’s generous R&D tax reliefs and \\nworld-leading capital allowance offer.\\nBox 2.B Tax policy making and simplification\\nA stable and predictable tax system is vital to create the conditions for sustained \\neconomic growth: it provides businesses with the stability and certainty needed \\nto make long-term investment decisions, it ensures that taxpayers pay the right \\namount of tax the first time round, and it reduces the administrative burden \\non taxpayers allowing businesses and workers to focus on adding value to the \\neconomy.\\nThe government will engage with stakeholders over the coming months to \\nunderstand their views on where the tax policy making process works well, and \\nwhat could be improved. The government is committed to a single major fiscal \\nevent per year.\\nThe government will simplify the tax system and will take this forward as part \\nof its three strategic priorities for HMRC: closing the tax gap, modernisation and \\nreform, and improving customer service.\\n78 ONS and industry data, via the British Beer and Pub Association, 202448\\nAutumn Budget 2024The government will announce a package of measures to simplify tax \\nadministration and improve the customer experience in spring 2025 with a \\nfocus on reducing burdens on small businesses. The government will meet \\nstakeholders to understand the priorities for administration and simplification, \\nensuring that this work is driven by the views of taxpayers.\\nMoving to a fairer and more sustainable tax system\\n2.47  Repairing the public finances and increasing funding for public services \\nmeans raising more revenue, but the government is doing this in a way that \\nprotects working people and makes the tax system fairer and more sustainable.\\n2.48  The government is raising revenue by increasing Capital Gains Tax (CGT), \\nwhile ensuring that the UK tax system remains internationally competitive, with \\nheadline rates below France, Germany and Italy. CGT, which is paid on the increase \\nin value of an asset when it is disposed of, is paid by fewer than 1% of adults each \\nyear. The main rates of CGT are currently charged at a lower rate of 10% and a \\nhigher rate of 20%, and these will be increased to 18% and 24% respectively from 30 \\nOctober 2024. These new rates will match the residential property rates, which are \\nnot changing.\\n2.49  There are two reliefs which offer access to a lower rate of CGT: Business Asset \\nDisposal Relief (BADR), and Investors’ Relief (IR). The rate for both BADR and IR \\nwill increase gradually, to give business owners time to adjust to the changes. \\nThe BADR and IR rates will rise to 14% from 6 April 2025, and will match the main \\nlower rate of 18% from 6 April 2026. Phasing in the BADR and IR rate increases \\ndemonstrates the government’s commitment to a predictable tax system. The \\ngovernment is committed to creating a positive environment for entrepreneurship \\nand will work with leading entrepreneurs and venture capital firms on how policy \\nsupports that, including the role of the existing tax schemes.\\n2.50 The vast majority of estates currently pay no inheritance tax, and that will \\ncontinue to be the case after the reforms announced at Budget.79 The government \\nrecognises that people want to pass on their assets to their families, but the \\ngovernment is making the inheritance tax system fairer by ensuring that wealthy \\nestates contribute more to the public finances. The current inheritance tax \\nthresholds are due to be frozen until April 2028, and the government is extending \\nthese threshold freezes for a further two years to April 2030.\\n2.51 The government will reform agricultural property relief and business property \\nrelief from April 2026. In addition to existing nil-rate bands and exemptions, the \\n100% rate of relief will continue for the first £1 million of combined agricultural \\nand business assets to help protect family farms and businesses, and will be 50% \\nthereafter. The government will also reduce the rate of business property relief to \\n50% in all circumstances for shares designated as “not listed” on the markets of \\na recognised stock exchange, such as AIM. This will affect around 0.3% of estates \\neach year.80 The government is also removing the opportunity for individuals to use \\npensions as a vehicle for inheritance tax planning by bringing unspent pots into \\nthe scope of inheritance tax from April 2027, which will affect around 8% of estates \\neach year.81\\n79 ‘Economic and Fiscal Outlook’, Office for Budget Responsibility, October 2024.\\n80 HMRC internal analysis based on ‘Economic and Fiscal Outlook’, Office for Budget Responsibility, October 2024.\\n81 HMRC internal analysis based on ‘Economic and Fiscal Outlook’, Office for Budget Responsibility, October 2024.49\\nAutumn Budget 20242.52 The government is committed to fixing the NHS, which means focusing \\non prevention, including disincentivising activities that cause ill health. The \\ngovernment will renew the Tobacco Duty escalator of RPI+2% for the remainder of \\nthis Parliament and will increase duty by a further 10% on hand-rolling tobacco this \\nyear. A new Vaping Products Duty will be introduced from 1 October 2026 at a flat \\nrate of £2.20 per 10ml vaping liquid, accompanied by an equivalent further one-off \\nincrease in Tobacco Duty to maintain the financial incentive to switch from tobacco \\nto vaping.\\n2.53 To help tackle obesity and other harms caused by high sugar intake, the \\ngovernment will ensure that the  Soft Drinks Industry Levy increases to maintain \\nincentives for soft drinks manufacturers to reduce their sugar content. The \\ngovernment will also review the current sugar thresholds and the exemption for \\nmilk-based drinks.\\n2.54 While the government is cutting duty on draught products, it has also \\nheard representations to increase alcohol duty by more than inflation to tackle \\nincreasing alcohol-related deaths, as well as economic inactivity. The government \\nis also mindful of the cost of living pressures on people who drink moderately and \\nresponsibly. Balancing these pressures, the government will uprate alcohol duty  in \\nline with RPI, except for most drinks in pubs. Increasing the non-draught rates of \\nalcohol duty  while reducing draught rates will encourage responsible drinking in \\nsocial, controlled settings.\\n2.55 Air Passenger Duty rates have fallen behind inflation, and private jets are \\nrelatively undertaxed. For 2026-27, the government will adjust all APD rates to help \\ncorrect for below-inflation uprating in recent years. This will equate to £2 more for \\nthose flying to short -haul destinations in economy class. The higher rate for larger \\nprivate jets will rise by a further 50%, and the government will consult on extending \\nthis rate to all private jets within the APD regime.\\nDelivering tax commitments\\n2.56 Everyone who makes their home in the UK should pay their taxes here. The \\ngovernment is removing the outdated concept of domicile status from the tax \\nsystem and replacing it with a  new internationally competitive residence-based \\nregime from 6 April 2025. This includes ending the use of offshore trusts to shelter \\nassets from Inheritance Tax and scrapping the planned 50% tax reduction for \\nforeign income in the first year of the new regime.\\n2.57 Carried interest is a\\xa0performance-related reward received by a small \\npopulation of fund management executives. Unlike other forms of compensation, \\ncarried interest can be subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), where certain conditions \\nare met. The government believes there is a compelling case for reform in this \\narea.\\xa0From April 2026, carried interest will be taxed fully within the Income Tax \\nframework, with bespoke rules to reflect its unique characteristics – providing for \\nfairer and more sustainable outcomes, while safeguarding the strength of the \\nUK as a fund management hub. Ahead of this, the CGT rates currently applied to \\ncarried interest will be increased to 32% from April 2025.\\n2.58 The government is supporting first-time and main home buyers by increasing \\nthe Higher Rates for Additional Dwellings of Stamp Duty Land Tax from 3% to 5% \\nfrom 31 October 2024. These higher rates apply to purchases of second homes, \\nbuy-to-let residential properties and companies purchasing residential property \\nand the increase will provide those looking to move home or purchase their first 50\\nAutumn Budget 2024property with a comparative advantage over those purchasing additional property. \\nThis is expected to result in 130,000 additional transactions over the next five years \\nby first-time buyers and other people buying a primary residence.82 Those who \\nexchanged contracts prior to 31 October 2024 are not affected by this rate increase.\\n2.59 One of the government’s key missions is to make the UK a clean energy \\nsuperpower. To achieve that, it is essential that oil and gas companies contribute \\nmore to the energy transition: this is why the government is making changes to the \\nEnergy Profits Levy (EPL) including increasing its rate by three percentage points \\nto 38%, removing the 29% investment allowance, and extending the time the levy \\napplies until 31 March 2030.\\n2.60 The government is committed to managing the energy transition in a way \\nthat supports jobs in existing and future industries and so will retain the availability \\nof 100% first year capital allowances  within the EPL. As announced in July, the \\ndecarbonisation allowance will also remain in order to incentivise the sector to \\ninvest in cleaner, lower-emission technologies and will be set at 66% to maintain its \\ncash value. \\n2.61 After a period of change, the government also recognises the importance \\nof providing the oil and gas industry with long-term certainty on taxation. The \\ngovernment will publish a consultation in early 2025 on how the taxation of \\noffshore oil and gas will respond to price shocks once EPL ends in 2030. In addition, \\nthe government is today publishing a consultation on new environmental \\nguidance for assessing end use emissions related to oil and gas projects. This \\nconsultation seeks to provide stability for the oil and gas industry, support \\ninvestment, protect jobs and ensure a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the \\nNorth Sea in line with our climate and legal obligations.\\n2.62 The government is committed to ensuring that every child has access to \\nhigh-quality education. To secure additional funding to help deliver commitments \\nrelating to education and young people, the government will introduce 20% VAT \\non education and boarding services provided for a charge by private schools  from \\n1 January 2025. The government will also remove business rates charitable rate \\nrelief from private schools in England from April 2025. Together, these policies are \\nexpected to raise £1.8 billion per year by 2029 -30. The impact on the state education \\nsystem as a whole is expected to be very small.\\n2.63 To support pupils with special educational needs that can only be met in a \\nprivate school, local authorities and devolved governments that fund these places \\nwill be compensated for the VAT they are charged on those pupils’ fees.\\xa0Private \\nschools which are “wholly or mainly” concerned with providing full time education \\nto pupils with an Education, Health and Care Plan will remain eligible for business \\nrates charitable relief.\\nFixing the NHS and reforming public services\\n2.64 Phase 1 of Spending Review 2025, which concludes alongside Autumn \\nBudget 2024, provides significant additional investment to reset departmental \\nbudgets, and support public services. Improving the performance of public services \\nforms a core part of the government’s plan for driving growth. \\n82 ‘Economic and Fiscal Outlook’, Office for Budget Responsibility, October 2024.51\\nAutumn Budget 20242.65 At Autumn Budget 2024, the government is committing to one major fiscal \\nevent a year. The government has fixed the envelope for Phase 2 of the Spending \\nReview consistent with the fiscal rules. It will conclude in late spring 2025. \\nSupporting public services\\n2.66 Phase 1 of the Spending Review focuses on delivery of the government’s first \\nsteps for change, including: \\n• Reducing waiting times by supporting the NHS to deliver 40,000 extra \\nelective appointments a week and make progress towards the commitment \\nthat patients should expect to wait no longer than 18 weeks from referral to \\nconsultant-led treatment. \\n• Securing the UK’s borders by establishing a new Border Security Command \\nto tackle criminal gangs, reducing both irregular migration and the flow of \\nillicit commodities towards the UK, and safeguarding victims of trafficking and \\nsmuggling. \\n• Increasing powers to address anti-social behaviour, strengthening \\nneighbourhood policing and establishing the first trailblazer Young Futures \\nHubs in England. \\n• Further supporting recruitment of 6,500 new teachers in England, through \\nincreases to the core schools budget of £2.3\\xa0billion. \\n• Establishing Great British Energy with £125\\xa0million in 2025- 26. \\n2.67 Beyond these first steps, Phase 1 of the Spending Review confirms 2024 -25 and \\n2025- 26 budgets for all departments, providing the targeted funding necessary to \\nstabilise and support public services.\\nFixing the NHS\\n2.68 The NHS is a source of immense national pride, and this government wants \\nto ensure that the healthcare system is there for people when they need it. \\nThat is why in his first week, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care \\ncommissioned Lord Darzi to conduct an immediate and independent investigation \\nof NHS performance and the challenges facing the healthcare system. \\n2.69 Lord Darzi’s report clearly set out the scale of the challenge – he found the \\nNHS was in “critical condition”.83 The waiting list for elective treatment currently \\nstands at 7.6\\xa0million, people are waiting too long to get the GP or NHS dentist \\nappointments they need, and 10% of patients are now waiting for 12 hours or \\nmore in A&E.84,85 This is in part due to a wider set of challenges: the health of the \\nnation has deteriorated and there are significant inequalities in health and care. \\nRestoring the health service will therefore take time and will require the drivers of \\nperformance that Lord\\xa0Darzi identified to be addressed. \\n2.70  The government is prioritising the NHS in Phase 1 of the Spending Review. \\nThe settlement means resource spending for the Department of Health and Social \\nCare (DHSC) will increase by £22.6\\xa0billion from 2023- 24 to 2025- 26. This provides a \\ntwo year average real terms NHS growth rate of 4.0%, the highest since before 2010 \\n83 ‘Independent investigation of the NHS in England - Lord Darzi’s report on the state of the National Health Service \\nin England ’, Department of Health and Social Care, September 2024. .\\n84 ‘Statistical Press Notice - NHS referral to treatment (RTT) waiting times data ’, NHS England, October 2024.\\n85 ‘A&E Activity and Performance Summary ’ published in ‘ A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions ’, NHS \\nEngland, October 2024.52\\nAutumn Budget 2024excluding COVID-19 pandemic years.86 The settlement will reduce waiting times \\nby supporting the NHS to deliver 40,000 extra elective appointments a week and \\nmake progress towards the commitment that patients should expect to wait no \\nlonger than 18 weeks from referral to consultant-led treatment. This includes an \\nadditional £1.8\\xa0billion to support elective activity since July. In tandem, patient care \\npathways will be reformed to ensure patients are seen in settings which can deliver \\nbetter patient experience for lower cost, enhancing patient choice and embedding \\nbest practice right across the country. \\n2.71 Lord Darzi found the NHS had been “starved of capital” funding during \\nthe 2010s – a £37\\xa0billion shortfall – and that this has prevented hospitals being \\nproductive. The government will take significant steps to address this. Phase 1 of \\nthe Spending Review provides record levels of capital investment for health with an \\nincrease of £3.1\\xa0billion in 2025- 26 compared to 2023-24 outturn, rising to £13.6\\xa0billion, \\na two-year average real terms growth rate of 10.9%. This will: \\n• Support NHS performance across secondary care with around £1.5\\xa0billion \\ncapital funding in total for new surgical hubs and diagnostic scanners to build \\ncapacity for over 30,000 additional procedures, and over 1.25\\xa0million diagnostic \\ntests as they come online; new beds to create more treatment space in \\nemergency departments, reduce waiting times and help shift more care into \\nthe community; and £70\\xa0million to invest in new radiotherapy machines to \\nimprove cancer treatment. \\n• Begin to reverse the trend of capital underfunding of the last 15 years identified \\nby Lord Darzi, with over £1\\xa0billion to tackle dangerous reinforced autoclaved \\naerated concrete (RAAC) and make inroads into the existing backlog of critical \\nmaintenance, repairs and upgrades across the NHS estate – protecting staff \\nand patients and boosting NHS productivity. \\n• Invest more than £2\\xa0billion in NHS technology and digital to run essential \\nservices and drive NHS productivity improvements, to free up staff time, ensure \\nall Trusts have Electronic Patient Records, improve cyber security and enhance \\npatient access through the NHS App. In implementing the settlement, DHSC \\n(including the NHS) will deliver 2% productivity next year.  \\n• Establish a dedicated fund to deliver around 200 upgrades to GP surgeries \\nacross England, supporting improved use of existing buildings and space, \\nboosting productivity and enabling practices to deliver more patient \\nappointments. \\n• Continue delivery of the New Hospital Programme on a more sustainable \\nand deliverable footing, moving swiftly to rebuild hospitals wholly or primarily \\nbuilt with RAAC or which are in build. Remaining schemes will be delivered \\nthrough a rolling programme of major investment as part of the government’s \\ncommitment to providing hospital infrastructure investment. Further details \\nregarding the Programme review and next steps will be set out by DHSC in \\ndue course.\\n• Strengthen the UK’s pandemic preparedness and health protection with \\n£460\\xa0million of investment to address the risk posed by future health \\nemergencies and implement the lessons learnt from the pandemic by \\n86 2019 -20 to 2021- 22.53\\nAutumn Budget 2024replenishing personal protection equipment (PPE), vaccine and medicines \\nstockpiles, and investing in critical health protection infrastructure, such as \\nhigh-containment laboratories. \\n• Provide £26\\xa0million to open new mental health crisis centres, reducing pressure \\non A&E services. The government is committed to tackling the root causes of \\nmental health problems and supporting people to remain in, return to or find \\nwork.\\n• Protect core R&D budgets with a real terms increase in funding for the National \\nInstitute for Health and Care Research to support the NHS and wider health \\nand care system in driving a revolution in research, life sciences, med tech \\nand data. This will strengthen the UK clinical trial network, supporting better \\npatient outcomes, and bolster the life sciences investment environment.\\n2.72 The government will support local authority services through a real terms \\nincrease in core local government spending power of around 3.2%, including at \\nleast £600\\xa0million of new grant funding to support social care.87 This is alongside \\nan £86\\xa0million increase to the Disabled Facilities Grant to support 7,800 more \\nadaptations to homes for those with social care needs to reduce hospitalisations \\nand prolong independence. \\n2.73 Investment alone will not fix the current state of the NHS. The government’s \\n10\\xa0Year Health Plan will focus on the hard work of reform, increasing productivity \\nand ensuring every pound of taxpayers’ money is spent wisely through three shifts \\nin how healthcare is delivered: \\n• In shifting care from hospital to community the government wants to see \\nmore care delivered through Neighbourhood Health Services. These will \\nprovide more proactive and personalised care that will be better for patients \\nand deliver better value for taxpayers. The government will also reform delivery \\nof elective activity and patient care pathways, including a shift to lower cost \\nsettings wherever appropriate. \\n• In transforming the NHS from analogue to digital, the government is investing \\nto deliver NHS productivity improvements, by harnessing technological \\nopportunities that will transform the patient experience, free up staff time and \\nimprove the quality of care.\\n• In moving from a model of sickness to prevention, the government is taking \\naction against childhood and adult obesity and creating the first smoke-free \\ngeneration. The government will restrict junk food advertising on TV and online \\nto reduce the number of children living with obesity; and gradually end the \\nsale of tobacco products across the country, ban vapes from being deliberately \\nbranded and advertised to children, and deliver an ambitious package of \\nsupport to help current smokers to quit. \\nEducation\\n2.74 The Department for Education’s (DfE) settlement means resource spending \\non the education system in England will increase by £11.2\\xa0billion from 2023- 24 levels \\nby 2025- 26, a 3.5% real terms increase. This funding demonstrates the government’s \\ncommitment to schools, giving every child the best start in life, supporting \\ndisadvantaged children, and investing in further education (FE), through: \\n87 The underlying figure for core spending power is an estimate and subject to data changes. Final figures will be \\npublished as part of the 2025- 26 Local Government Finance Settlement.54\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Increasing funding for the core schools budget by £2.3\\xa0billion, increasing per \\npupil funding in real terms. £1\\xa0billion of this funding will go towards supporting \\nthe special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) system. \\n• Allocating an additional £1.8\\xa0billion to continue the expansion of government \\nfunded childcare, providing young children with high-quality early education. \\nAlong with £30\\xa0million being provided for the rollout of free breakfast clubs \\nin thousands of primary schools, this will also help parents, and particularly \\nmothers, to stay in and return to work. \\n• Providing an additional £300\\xa0million for FE to ensure young people are \\ndeveloping the skills they need to succeed and taking steps to transform \\nthe Apprenticeship Levy into a Growth and Skills Levy through £40\\xa0million \\ninvestment. This will help to deliver on the commitment to launch shorter and \\nfoundation apprenticeships in key sectors. \\n2.75 The government is also providing £6.7\\xa0billion of capital funding in 2025- 26 \\nfor education in England, a real terms increase of 19% from 2024 -25. This includes \\n£1.4\\xa0billion for the school rebuilding programme, an increase of £550\\xa0million on this \\nyear. The settlement also invests over £2\\xa0billion into maintenance for schools and \\n£950\\xa0million for skills capital. \\nCrime and justice\\n2.76 The government will begin to repair the justice system by providing an \\nadditional £1.9\\xa0billion total departmental spending to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) \\nin 2025- 26 – an average real terms increase of 5.6% each year from 2023- 24 to \\n2025- 26. Total Home Office (HO) funding will increase from £20.3\\xa0billion in 2023- 24 \\nto £22.1\\xa0billion in 2025- 26. \\n• Continued investment to support frontline policing levels across the country \\nand put us on track to start to deliver more neighbourhood police officers and \\nPolice Community Support Officers (PCSO). \\n• £2.3\\xa0billion of investment in prison expansion over 2024 -25 and 2025- 26, \\nensuring thousands of new prison places open over the next two years. \\n• A minimum £500\\xa0million additional investment across prisons and probation \\nin 2025- 26 to recruit thousands of new prison and probation staff, keeping \\nprisons safe and managing offenders in the community. \\n• £220\\xa0million investment in prison and probation service maintenance in \\n2024 -25 and up to £300\\xa0million in 2025- 26, keeping prisons safe and secure. \\n• 106,500 Crown Court sitting days in 2024 -25 to bring offenders to justice. MoJ \\nwill work closely with the senior judiciary to set court capacity in 2025- 26 to \\ncontinue bringing access to justice for victims. \\nDefence and intelligence\\n2.77 The settlement provides £2.9\\xa0billion of additional total funding to the \\nMinistry of Defence (MoD) compared to 2024 -25, growing the defence budget by \\n2.3% per year on average in real terms compared to 2023- 24. This underlines the \\ngovernment’s commitment to strengthening the Armed Forces and protecting \\nnational security during a period of geopolitical instability.55\\nAutumn Budget 20242.78 This means the defence budget will grow in line with the economy in 2025- 26, \\nensuring the UK comfortably exceeds the NATO spending target of 2% of GDP. The \\ngovernment will set a path to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence at a future fiscal \\nevent. This funding will:  \\n• Enable the UK to modernise the Armed Forces and to continue to play a \\nleading role in NATO, including through the nuclear deterrent, combat and \\nsurveillance aircraft, surface and submarine fleets, forward land forces, Special \\nForces and cyber and space capabilities.\\n• Guarantee continued support to Ukraine, committing £3\\xa0billion per year in \\nsupport for Ukraine for as long as it takes.  \\n2.79 The government will also provide funding to DCMS to commemorate the \\n80th anniversary of VE and VJ day, to remember those who gave their lives and \\nhonour those who served at home and abroad. \\n2.80 In addition to growing the defence budget, the settlement will increase \\nspending on the Single Intelligence Account (SIA) by around £340\\xa0million \\nbetween 2023- 24 and 2025- 26. This funding increase will boost the UK’s national \\nsecurity, ensuring that the UK intelligence community maintains its world-leading \\ncapabilities – protecting the UK and advancing the country’s interests at home and \\noverseas.  \\nLocal government\\n2.81 Local government is essential to the running of the country and delivers \\na wide range of vital services. The government is committed to returning the \\nsector to sustainability through a comprehensive set of measures to support local \\nauthorities in England, including:  \\n• Increasing core spending power by around 3.2% in real terms in 2025- 26, with \\n£1.3\\xa0billion of new grant funding including at least £600\\xa0million new grant \\nfunding for social care.88 \\n• Reforming the approach to funding allocations within the Local Government \\nFinance Settlement by redistributing funding to ensure that it reflects an \\nup-\\xa0to-date assessment of need and local revenues.  \\n• Investing in children’s services to put them on a sustainable trajectory, with a \\n£1\\xa0billion uplift for SEND and alternative provision funding as an important step \\nin realising the government’s ambition to reform the system, and new funding \\nfor kinship and fostering measures ahead of more fundamental children’s \\nsocial care reform in Phase 2. \\n• Continuing the UK Shared Prosperity Fund at a reduced level for a further year, \\nproviding £900\\xa0million; this transitional arrangement will allow local authorities \\nto invest in local growth, in advance of wider funding reforms. \\n• Providing £233\\xa0million of additional spending in 2025- 26 to prevent \\nhomelessness, taking total spending to £1\\xa0billion in 2025- 26. This will help to \\nprevent rises in the number of families in temporary accommodation and help \\nto prevent rough sleeping. \\n88 The underlying figure for core spending power is an estimate and subject to data changes. Final figures will be \\npublished as part of the 2025- 26 Local Government Finance Settlement.56\\nAutumn Budget 2024Devolved governments\\n2.82 The devolved governments will receive an additional £6.6\\xa0billion through \\nthe operation of the Barnett formula in 2025- 26. This includes £3.4\\xa0billion for the \\nScottish Government, £1.7\\xa0billion for the Welsh Government and £1.5\\xa0billion for the \\nNorthern Ireland Executive. This will enable substantial investment into schools, \\nhousing, health and social care, and transport across Scotland, Wales and Northern \\nIreland.\\n2.83  In Wales, the government is providing the Welsh Government with \\n£25\\xa0million to support essential work to keep disused coal tips maintained and \\nsafe. In Northern Ireland, the government is also providing £730,000 to support \\nschools as they work towards integrated status, and a further £45.8\\xa0million for the \\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland’s Additional Security Fund and the Executive \\nProgramme on Paramilitarism and Organised Crime. In Scotland, the government \\nis providing funding to deliver ‘Brand Scotland’ to champion Scottish culture, \\nproducts and services across the world. \\nCompensation\\n2.84 The government is addressing the historic wrongs of the past and \\ncompensating the victims of the Post Office Horizon IT and Infected Blood \\nscandals:89 \\n• The government is committed to providing full and fair financial redress to the \\nvictims of the Horizon IT Scandal as quickly as possible. Around £1.8\\xa0billion has \\nbeen set aside for costs from 2024 -25, with around £200\\xa0million already paid to \\nvictims in previous years.90 \\n• The government has set out plans to compensate the victims of the infected \\nblood scandal, following recommendations from the Infected Blood Inquiry \\nand Sir Robert Francis KC.91,92,93 The Budget includes £11.8\\xa0billion of funding \\ncommitted to the end of the Parliament to make compensation payments. \\nThis is based on estimates of the number of people who are eligible and will \\napply, with the Infected Blood Compensation Authority aiming to process and \\nmake payments as soon as possible. The government expects the Authority to \\nbegin processing a small number of payments this year, scaling up in 2025. \\nPublic Sector Pay\\n2.85 The government launched the 2025- 26 Pay Review Body (PRB) process in \\nSeptember. This meant the 2025- 26 PRB process started three months earlier in \\nthe year than for 2024 -25. This is a step towards restoring confidence in the PRB \\nprocess and ensuring public sector workers receive more timely pay awards. The \\nPRBs are expected to deliver their recommendations for 2025- 26 pay awards in the \\nspring.\\n89 In both cases the costs from 2024 -25 onwards will be classified as Annually Managed Expenditure, and the \\nfunding set out in the Budget is neither a target nor a limit - those eligible will receive the compensation they are \\ndue.\\n90 Costs calculated on cash basis using the management information that was used to calculate ‘ Post Office \\nHorizon financial redress data as of 31 March 2024 ’, Department for Business and Trade, October 2024.\\n91 ‘Infected Blood Compensation Scheme Summary: August 2024 ’, Infected Blood Compensation Authority, Cabinet \\nOffice, August 2024.\\n92 ‘The Inquiry Report ’, Infected Blood Inquiry, May 2024. ‘ Second Interim Report ’, Infected Blood Inquiry, April 2023.\\n93 ‘Recommendations to the government from Sir Robert Francis KC ’, Infected Blood Compensation Authority, \\nAugust 2024.57\\nAutumn Budget 20242.86 Accepting the independent PRBs’ recommendations for 2024 -25 – and \\nproviding the first meaningful real terms pay increases for years – was not a \\ndecision the government took lightly.94 While it was the right decision, it required \\ndifficult trade-offs. The government has taken further difficult decisions across tax, \\nspending and welfare through the Budget and Phase 1 of the Spending Review in \\norder to repair the public finances. \\n2.87 The government remains committed to delivering fair and timely pay awards \\nfor public sector workforces in 2025- 26. However, it will need to carefully consider \\nthe trade-offs required to afford pay awards. Over the medium-term, above \\ninflation pay awards are only affordable if they can be funded from improved \\nproductivity.\\n2.88 Departmental settlements for 2025- 26 will need to fund the next round of \\npublic sector pay awards, and departments will set out their affordability evidence \\nto the PRBs in the usual way, taking account of expected inflation over the next \\nfinancial year, forecast by the OBR to be 2.6%.95 If the PRBs recommend pay \\nawards above the level departments have budgeted for, the government will \\nhave to consider the justification – for example where there are especially acute \\nrecruitment and retention demands, or where productivity improvements can \\nunlock further funding.\\nSpending Review 2025 Phase 2\\n2.89 At the Budget, the government has fixed the envelope for Phase 2 of the \\nSpending Review, which will conclude in the late spring. It will deliver a new \\nsettlement for public services, marking a fundamental change in how the \\ngovernment approaches public spending, supports growth, and delivers public \\nservices.\\n2.90 Phase 2 will be mission led, technology enabled and reform driven. It will take \\na long-term approach, supporting delivery of the government’s plans for a decade \\nof national renewal. It will also embed greater spending discipline by implementing \\na zero-based approach, ensuring that every pound of taxpayers’ money is targeted \\ntowards the government’s priorities.\\n2.91 Phase 2 will also embed greater spending discipline by implementing a \\nzero-\\xa0based approach to spending, ensuring that every pound of taxpayers’ money \\nis targeted towards the government’s priorities.\\nMission-led\\n2.92 To fundamentally change the way public services are delivered, departments \\nmust work together to deliver key priorities in a more effective and efficient way, \\nbreaking out of siloes and focusing on driving forward the government’s core \\nobjectives. \\n2.93 The government will take a mission-led approach to Phase 2. Departments \\nwill work together to develop a shared strategy for delivering the government’s \\nmissions. \\n2.94 The government will support missions to drive collaboration across \\ngovernment and its partners and to target spending on the priorities that will \\ndeliver the biggest impact for citizens. \\n94 All 2024 -25 PRB reports are available at  Office for the Pay Review Bodies - GOV.UK.\\n95 ‘Economic and Fiscal Outlook’, Office for Budget Responsibility, October 2024.58\\nAutumn Budget 2024Technology-enabled\\n2.95 Phase 2 will focus on ensuring the public sector makes the best use of \\ntechnology, in order to digitise public service delivery, enhance productivity and \\nimprove outcomes. \\n2.96 The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Secretary of State for Science, \\nInnovation and Technology and Chief Secretary to the Treasury lead the Digital \\nCentre of Government. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology \\nwill continue to drive towards a renewed strategy for digital transformation across \\nthe public sector to ensure that fundamental reforms in public services are \\nprioritised and digital-led. This will inform a centralised and coherent approach to \\ndigital investment at Phase 2 of the Spending Review. \\nReform-driven\\n2.97 Phase 2 of Spending Review will focus on reforming the public sector, in \\norder to improve outcomes whilst keeping public spending at sustainable levels. \\nThe government will take a more preventative approach to public service delivery, \\nalongside devolving more power to communities to deliver more efficiently and \\neffectively for citizens.\\n2.98 The government has therefore identified a number of priority areas for reform, \\nwhich it will build on in Phase 2:\\n• Health:  The government will publish a 10 Year Health Plan for the NHS in \\nSpring 2025, investing in and transforming the existing model of health care, \\nand delivering the government’s mission to build an NHS fit for the future. This \\nplan will be shaped by the experiences, views and ideas of the public, clinicians, \\nand experts. The plan will set out reforms transform the NHS from analogue to \\ndigital and more from model of sickness to prevention shift care from hospital \\nto community.  \\n• Local government and devolution:  The government is introducing the \\nfirst integrated settlements for Greater Manchester and the West Midlands \\nCombined Authorities from 2025- 26, and announcing the next Mayoral \\nCombined Authorities eligible to receive them from 2026 -27, giving mayors \\nmeaningful local control over funding in a single flexible pot. The government \\nwill also simplify the wider local funding landscape, reducing the number of \\ngrants and consolidating them into the Local Government Finance Settlement, \\nas well as moving towards a multi-year settlement for local government so \\nlocal authorities can plan more effectively.. The upcoming English Devolution \\nWhite Paper will set out more detail on the government’s devolution plans, \\nincluding on working with councils to move to simpler structures that make \\nsense for their local areas, with efficiency savings from council reorganisation \\nhelping to meet the needs of local people. \\n• Children’s social care: Building on existing reform pathfinders, and the new \\ninvestment in kinship and fostering announced in Phase 1 of the Spending \\nReview, the government will set out plans for fundamental reform of the \\nchildren’s social care system in Phase 2. This will include promoting early \\nintervention to help children to stay with their families where possible and \\nfixing the broken care market.59\\nAutumn Budget 2024• SEND: Phase 1 of the Spending Review provides a £1\\xa0billion uplift for SEND \\nand alternative provision funding, equivalent to 6% real growth. This is an \\nimportant step towards realising the government’s vision to reform England’s \\nSEND provision to improve outcomes and return the system to financial \\nsustainability, which will be built on through Phase 2. \\n• Homelessness: Phase 1 commits to additional funding for homelessness to \\nhelp to prevent rises in the number of families in temporary accommodation \\nand help to prevent rough sleeping. In Phase 2 the Treasury will work \\nwith MHCLG and others in the cross-government taskforce to address \\nhomelessness and rough sleeping.\\n• Police:  HM Treasury will work with the Home Office through Phase 2 to drive \\npolice efficiencies and improve overall police productivity in England, ending \\nwasteful contracts and enabling officers to spend more time on the frontline \\ntackling crime. This will form part of a wider police reform package to rebuild \\nconfidence in policing. \\n• Prisons:  To bring an end to the crisis in prisons, the government will examine \\ntough alternatives to custody to make sure these sentences cut crime while \\nmaking the best use of taxpayers’ money. Along with the prison building \\nprogramme, the government will bring the criminal justice system onto a \\nsustainable and affordable footing and ensure there is always the space in \\nprison for the most dangerous offenders.\\n• Asylum: The government has already ended the Rwanda Migration and \\nEconomic Development Partnership and is reforming the asylum system by \\nstreamlining capacity to process asylum seekers and returning those that do \\nnot have the right to stay in the UK. This will start the process of ending the use \\nof hotels for asylum seekers.\\n• Defence: In Phase 2, the government will transform the defence operating \\nmodel, establishing a new Strategic Military Headquarters and National \\nArmaments Director role to create clearer accountability, faster delivery, less \\nwaste and deliver greater value for money.\\n• Transport: The government will improve the performance and reliability of rail \\nservices, ensuring the rail sector can operate effectively and become financially \\nsustainable. The Secretary of State for Transport’s plans for reform, will look at \\nchanges to fares, services and workforce practices to deliver a modern railway \\nthat meets how people now want to travel. These will increase efficiency \\nand reduce costs, while boosting ridership and revenue and improving \\nperformance, laying the groundwork for the transition to Great British Railways.\\n• Civil Service: The civil service is a key enabler to support improved productivity \\nacross the UK’s public services. This government is therefore taking forward \\nwork to deliver a civil service workforce plan and underpinning reform \\nproposals for a more efficient and effective civil service, including bold options \\nto improve skills, harness digital technology and drive better outcomes for \\npublic services.\\n2.99 The Budget also announces a new Public Sector Reform and Innovation \\nFund, to support the development of a new approach to improving public services. \\nThe Budget allocates £165\\xa0million of this to a range of projects in 2025- 26, including \\nto support foster carer recruitment and planning reform. In addition the Budget \\nallocates £100\\xa0million of this over the next three years to deliver innovative projects, 60\\nAutumn Budget 2024partnering with Mayors and local leaders, and developing new approaches to \\npublic service reform with a focus on experimentation and learning. This will \\ncomplement and inform ongoing reform programmes and activities being \\ndelivered by departments.\\n2.100 Further detail of specific reforms and investments announced at the Budget \\nare set out in the Departmental Settlements chapter of this document.61\\nAutumn Budget 20243Rebuilding Britain\\n3.1 The government is committed to delivering a decade of national renewal by \\nfixing the foundations of the economy and rebuilding Britain, making every part of \\nthe country better off.\\n3.2 The growth mission is the central mission of the government. Through the \\ngrowth mission, the government is restoring stability, increasing investment, and \\nreforming the economy to drive up prosperity and living standards across the UK. \\n3.3 Stability : Autumn Budget 2024 supports economic and fiscal stability and \\nputs the public finances on a sustainable path. These are essential foundations for \\ngrowth and for increasing public and private investment in the UK.\\n3.4 Investment :\\xa0Investment will be a vital part of addressing the growth challenge. \\nThe Budget begins rebuilding Britain by increasing public investment and \\nunlocking private investment. Public sector net investment will average 2.6% of \\nGDP over the Parliament, with over £100\\xa0billion of additional capital investment \\nover the next five years. This will strengthen the UK economy over the long term.\\n3.5 The Budget shows that the government is prioritising the investment that \\nmatters most. This includes investment in transport – unlocking growth- enhancing \\nschemes like East West Rail – kickstarting the delivery of 1.5\\xa0million homes, \\nsupporting new industries and job creation, and protecting record government \\nresearch and development (R&D) funding. In addition, the Budget increases \\ninvestment in public services, recognising that a well-functioning NHS and \\neducation system are critical to the economy.\\n3.6 The government is ensuring an even greater focus on high- quality investment \\nand delivering value for money for the taxpayer. With the guardrails that will govern \\nthe approach to capital spending and new and strengthened institutions, the \\ngovernment is reforming the way it plans, assures, delivers and evaluates capital \\nspending. These changes will provide greater certainty for departments, investors \\nand supply chains, and greater assurance that investment is high quality and well \\ndelivered.\\n3.7 The government will work in partnership with the private sector to further \\nincrease investment. The government has created the National Wealth Fund to \\ncatalyse over £70\\xa0billion of private investment, set out plans for a modern Industrial \\nStrategy to support investment in growth- driving sectors, and launched a pensions \\nreview to unlock greater investment in UK growth assets. The international \\nbusiness community has already put its confidence in the UK’s growth potential, \\ncommitting £63\\xa0billion across 22 projects around the International Investment \\nSummit and supporting the creation of close to 38,000 additional jobs.96\\n96 https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-breaking-international-investment-summit-secures-63-billion-and-\\nnearly-38000-jobs-for-the-uk .62\\nAutumn Budget 20243.8 Reform : The government is making the reforms needed to deliver sustained \\ngrowth in the long- term. These include ambitious planning reforms to remove \\nblockages to growth, the development of a 10 -year infrastructure strategy to be \\npublished alongside Phase 2 of the Spending Review, the publication of the Get \\nBritain Working White Paper shortly, and the establishment of Skills England to \\nensure there is the highly -trained workforce needed to deliver economic growth.\\n3.9 While the impacts of many of these measures are not captured in the OBR \\nforecast, the government expects them to have a positive impact on growth. This \\nreflects the feedback received from businesses, economists, and other stakeholders \\non the impact of the measures themselves and the challenges they are tackling. \\nThe OBR notes that the proposed changes to the National Planning Policy \\nFramework, which are not captured in the forecast, “may enable greater delivery \\nof new housing and infrastructure projects, which would boost the associated \\ninvestment flows, as well as increasing productivity over the longer term”.97\\n3.10 The OBR has set out the positive economic impact that the Budget could \\nhave over the long term. The OBR’s projections for the economy are covered in \\nmore detail in Chapter 1.\\n3.11 The government’s growth policy priorities, under the framework of stability, \\ninvestment and reform, can be structured into seven pillars, as illustrated below. \\nThese priorities will be developed in partnership with business, and backed by a \\ncontinuous focus on delivery, supported by a new Growth Delivery Unit established \\nin HM Treasury. The remainder of this chapter sets out the government’s plans \\nwithin each pillar.\\nTHE GROWTH MISSION\\nRebuilding Britain\\nFixing the FoundationsEconomic \\nand Fiscal \\nStability\\nMacroeconomic \\nand ﬁnancial \\nstability, ﬁscal \\nsustainability \\nand policy \\ncertainty.Investment, \\nInfrastructure \\nand Planning\\nHigher public \\nand private \\ninvestment, \\nimproved \\ninfrastructure \\nlike transport, \\nand planning \\nreform.People\\nMore people in \\ngood jobs, \\nimproved \\nemployment \\nprospects,\\nskills, and \\nproductivity.Place\\nRegional \\ngrowth through \\ninvestment, \\ndevolution and \\nreform, and \\nsupport for \\nhouse building.Industrial \\nStrategy\\nand Trade\\nAn Industrial \\nStrategy and a \\nTrade Strategy \\nto bolster \\ngrowth-driving \\nsectors and \\nfree, open trade.Innovation\\nSupport for \\nscientiﬁc \\nbreakthroughs,\\nR&D, and the \\ndiffusion of \\ntechnologies,\\nincluding Al.Net Zero\\nNet Zero \\ndelivered\\nin a way that\\nsupports growth \\nand captures \\neconomic \\nopportunities.\\nEconomic and Fiscal Stability\\n3.12 Economic, fiscal, and financial stability are pre -requisites for the economy \\nto grow, as they give UK businesses and households the confidence to make \\ndecisions on future investments and consumption. This encourages innovation \\nand growth over the long term. As set out in Box 1.B in Chapter 1, measures of \\nuncertainty have been elevated in recent years, reflecting global and UK specific \\n97 Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Office for Budget Responsibility, October 2024.63\\nAutumn Budget 2024factors. This instability has weighed on economic activity, as firms postponed \\ninvestment decisions and households reduced consumption in favour of \\nprecautionary saving.\\n3.13 At the Budget, the government is: announcing robust fiscal rules; taking \\ndifficult decisions on tax, welfare, and spending to put the public finances on a \\nsustainable path; and implementing the most significant strengthening of the \\nfiscal framework since the inception of the OBR. Details of these actions are set out \\nin Chapter 1.\\n3.14 In addition, the government is ensuring it fosters stability across all the pillars \\nof the growth mission by providing long- term certainty in its plans for businesses \\nand the wider economy. As set out below, this includes a commitment to a modern \\nIndustrial Strategy and a long- term plan for infrastructure.\\nInvestment, Infrastructure and Planning\\n3.15 Investment today drives future productivity growth and higher living \\nstandards. In the last 14 years, however, the UK has fallen further behind its peers, \\nwith productivity 16% below Germany and 14% below France in 2023.98\\n3.16 Since July, the government has taken decisive action to increase investment in \\nthe UK economy and drive growth, including:\\n• Launching the National Wealth Fund, the UK’s new impact investor, which \\nwill mobilise\\xa0billions of pounds of investment into the UK’s world leading \\nclean energy and growth industries and support the delivery of the Industrial \\nStrategy.\\n• Committing to update relevant National Policy Statements within 12 months \\nto provide certainty to industry on the objectives for nationally significant \\ninfrastructure.\\n• Acting to progress infrastructure projects through the planning system. \\nSince the election, the government has approved six Nationally Significant \\nInfrastructure Projects, including: construction consent for four solar farms, \\nwhich will provide almost two gigawatts of electricity generating capacity; \\nconsent to reinforce the electricity transmission network between Bramford \\nsubstation in Suffolk and Twinstead Tee in Essex; and development consent for \\na new roll-on/roll-off facility in Immingham Eastern Ro -Ro Port Terminal.\\n• The Deputy Prime Minister has also used powers to take decision-making \\nresponsibility for a number of appeals below the threshold for Nationally \\nSignificant Infrastructure Projects, including three data centres, two solar \\nsites, and two film studios. Seven cases have been sent to ministers for a \\ndecision on whether to grant planning permission, and all decisions have been \\nmade inside the 13- week target, giving developers and other stakeholders \\ncertainty within the right timescales. This includes approving the expansion of \\nLondon City Airport, in line with the government’s position to support airport \\nexpansions where they contribute to economic growth, whilst balancing \\nenvironmental objectives, and three large housing development sites in \\nCambridgeshire, West Sussex and Durham, leading the way for thousands of \\nnew homes.\\n98 Output per hour for the year 2023, using US$ current prices adjusted for PPP, OECD.64\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Reforming and expanding the Office for Investment, which will sit under the \\njoint HMT -DBT Minister for Investment, improving the government’s ability to \\nland transformational investments by originating deals, clearing barriers and \\nworking with local leaders to develop investable propositions.\\n• £63\\xa0billion of private sector investment across 22 projects was announced \\naround the October International Investment Summit, demonstrating the \\nincreased confidence of international investors in the UK and supporting the \\ncreation of close to 38,000 additional jobs.99\\n3.17 The Budget builds on this progress and decisively shifts the UK’s course on \\npublic investment. Instead of cutting investment, the government is increasing \\ninvestment in real terms. The government will spend 2.6% of GDP on public \\nsector net investment on average over the Parliament, with an increase of over \\n£100\\xa0billion in capital investment over the next five years.\\n3.18 Capital investment will increase by £13\\xa0billion next year, taking total \\ndepartmental capital spending to £131\\xa0billion in 2025- 26. Taken together, the \\ngovernment will invest over £35\\xa0billion in economic infrastructure in 2025- 26. The \\nOBR judges that if sustained beyond the forecast horizon, the combination of \\nhigher capital investment and crowding in increases potential output by 0.4% after \\n10 years and 1.4% in the long run.\\n3.19 This public investment will get Britain moving and spur regional growth and \\ninnovation, through:\\n• Securing the delivery of priority transport schemes, which will transform rail \\nconnectivity across the country.\\n• The Transpennine Route Upgrade between York and Manchester, via \\nLeeds and Huddersfield, will transform northern rail connectivity and lay \\nthe ground for Northern Powerhouse Rail.\\n• East West Rail will connect Oxford, Milton Keynes, and Cambridge and \\nunlock land for housing and laboratories, supporting the wider Cambridge \\nlife sciences cluster. The first East West Rail services will begin operations \\nnext year, running between Oxford, Bletchley, and Milton Keynes. The \\nacceleration of the Marston Vale Line will ensure these services extend \\nto Bedford from 2030. To deliver the next stages of East West Rail the \\ngovernment is launching a consultation.\\n• Progressing HS2 Phase One to improve connectivity between London \\nand Birmingham, and increase capacity on the West Coast Mainline, while \\ndelivering the Secretary of State for Transport’s commitments to control \\ncosts and bring the project back on track.\\n• HS2 trains will run to Euston, with funding provided for tunnelling to the \\ncentral London terminus, catalysing private investment into the station \\nand local area. Investment at Euston will be further supported through the \\nappointment of Bek Seeley to chair the Euston Housing Delivery Group, to \\ndrive forward an ambitious housing and regeneration initiative for the local \\narea.\\n99 https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-breaking-international-investment-summit-secures-63-billion-and-\\nnearly-38000-jobs-for-the-uk .65\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Providing a nearly 50% increase, on 2024 -25, in funding for local roads \\nmaintenance. This will go further than the government’s commitment to \\nfix an additional one million potholes across England each year, investing \\nalmost £1.6\\xa0billion to maintain and renew the nation’s roads, an increase of \\n£500\\xa0million on 2024 -25.100\\n• Building more homes to unlock growth. The government is adding \\n£500\\xa0million to the Affordable Homes Programme to kickstart the biggest \\nincrease to social and affordable housebuilding in a generation, putting us on \\nthe path to building 1.5\\xa0million homes over this Parliament.\\n• Delivering and protecting record levels of government R&D investment, with \\n£20.4\\xa0billion allocated in 2025- 26.\\n• Investing over £500\\xa0million in 2025- 26 to deliver Project Gigabit and Shared \\nRural Network to drive the rollout of digital infrastructure to underserved parts \\nof the UK, including delivering full gigabit broadband coverage by 2030.\\n• Leveraging £8\\xa0billion of private investment in Carbon Capture, Usage and \\nStorage infrastructure, continuing funding for the development of Sizewell C, \\nand providing funding to kickstart Great British Energy. The Net Zero section \\nbelow provides further details of the government’s investments in the Net Zero \\ntransition.\\n• Providing record levels of capital investment for health, which will start to \\naddress some of the key findings of the Darzi review and includes £1\\xa0billion \\nin additional capital for the NHS to address critical maintenance, repairs, \\nand upgrades across the estate, £1.5\\xa0billion for NHS beds and diagnostic and \\nsurgical capacity in England to help bring down waiting lists and support \\npeople back into work, £1\\xa0billion for technology to boost NHS productivity, and \\nover £2\\xa0billion for health R&D to drive innovation and support the UK’s leading \\nlife sciences sector.101\\n• Investing in schools to support learning, which is the bedrock of future growth \\nand opportunity. The government is providing £1.4\\xa0billion for the school \\nrebuilding programme, representing an increase of £550\\xa0million on this year \\nto support the current programme, including plans for 100 projects to begin \\ndelivery across England next year.\\n• Confirming long- term funding for growth- driving sectors as part of the \\nIndustrial Strategy, including £975\\xa0million for the aerospace sector over 5 \\nyears, over £2\\xa0billion over 5 years to support the automotive sector, and up to \\n£520\\xa0million for a new Life Sciences Innovative Manufacturing Fund.\\n3.20 The government is taking steps to ensure an even greater focus on \\nhigh- quality investment and delivering value for money for the taxpayer. As part of \\nthe guardrails set out in Chapter 1, the government is reforming the way it plans, \\nassures, delivers and evaluates capital spending. These changes will provide greater \\ncertainty for departments, investors and supply chains, and greater assurance that \\nthe investment is high quality and well delivered. These reforms include:\\n100 Baseline funding for highways maintenance in 2024-25 is made up of the following funding pots: Highways \\nMaintenance Block (HMB) needs, Highways Maintenance Block (HMB) incentive, Potholes funding, 2024-25 \\nNetwork North Uplift. The baseline does not include the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements equivalent \\nlevels in the HMB and Potholes funding pots, which are accounted for elsewhere, and does not include the \\nIntegrated Transport Block because it is not dedicated spend on highways maintenance. These are published \\nonline. In 2025-26, £500\\xa0million has been allocated on top of that baseline.\\n101 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-investigation-of-the-nhs-in-england .66\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Publishing the 10 -year infrastructure strategy alongside Phase 2 of the \\nSpending Review, outlining the government’s long- term approach.\\n• Setting five -year capital budgets, to be extended every two years at regular \\nspending reviews. This will eliminate damaging ‘cliff edges’ in budgets, giving \\ndepartments and supply chains more certainty.\\n• Increasing the transparency of investment decisions by publishing business \\ncases for major projects and programmes.\\n3.21 The government will underpin these reforms with new and strengthened \\ninstitutions, including:\\n• Establishing the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority \\n(NISTA) to drive more effective delivery of infrastructure across the country. \\nNISTA will combine the functions of the National Infrastructure Commission \\nand the Infrastructure and Projects Authority. NISTA will be operational by \\nspring 2025 and will implement the government’s infrastructure strategy in \\nconjunction with industry and, alongside existing assurance mechanisms, \\nwill have an enhanced role in supporting major projects, including validating \\nbusiness cases prior to HMT funding approval.\\n• Formally launching the Office for Value for Money (OVfM), with the \\nappointment of an independent chair. As a first step, the chair will advise the \\nChancellor and Chief Secretary to the Treasury on decisions for the multi- year \\nSpending Review. This will include an assessment of where and how to root \\nout waste and inefficiency, value for money studies in high-risk areas of \\ncross- departmental spending, and scrutiny of investment proposals to ensure \\nthey offer value for money.\\n• Working with the National Audit Office (NAO) to benefit from their scrutiny of \\ncapital projects and learn lessons which can be applied to future projects.\\n3.22 The government will continue to take action to ensure that the planning \\nsystem supports public and private investment. This includes:\\n• Responding to the National Planning Policy Framework consultation before \\nthe end of the year to confirm pro -growth reforms to the planning system.\\n• Implementing legislative changes to ensure a simplified and streamlined \\nplanning system, through the Planning and Infrastructure Bill to be introduced \\nin Parliament early next year.\\n• Providing an additional £5\\xa0million to deliver improvements to the planning \\nregime for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects, as well as £46\\xa0million \\nto boost capacity and capability in local planning authorities.\\n• Allocating £70\\xa0million in 2025- 26 to support infrastructure and housing \\ndevelopment while boosting nature’s recovery.\\n3.23 In addition to these ambitious planning reforms, the government will take \\nfurther measures to catalyse private investment in the economy. This includes \\ncreating the National Wealth Fund to catalyse over £70\\xa0billion of private investment \\nin the UK’s clean energy and growth industries, and using the Pensions Investment \\nReview, along with the British Growth Partnership, to unlock more pension fund \\ninvestment into UK growth assets.67\\nAutumn Budget 20243.24 The government will also mobilise private investment to deliver positive social \\nimpacts through the development of a social impact investment vehicle. Industry \\nwill be engaged on the design of this vehicle, with further details to be announced \\nat Phase 2 of the Spending Review.\\n3.25 The UK has historically made less use of government -issued financial \\ninstruments (e.g. loans, equity, and guarantees) than many advanced economies. \\nThese are tools that can be used to support growth while also generating a positive \\nreturn for the taxpayer. The government’s new debt rule will recognise the value \\ncreated by these investments, thereby supporting growth policies in a fiscally \\nsustainable way.\\n3.26 To provide stability and predictability for business, the government is \\npublishing the Corporate Tax Roadmap. Central to the Roadmap is a competitive \\nand sustainable main rate of Corporation Tax, capped at 25%, which is the lowest \\nin the G7, as well as a commitment to maintain the UK’s generous R&D tax reliefs \\nand competitive capital allowance offer. The government will also consult on a \\nmechanism for providing investors in major projects with greater tax certainty in \\nadvance, and consult on the tax treatment of pre-development costs.\\nPlace\\n3.27 The growth mission is based on creating good jobs and spreading prosperity \\nacross the United Kingdom, working closely with local leaders and the devolved \\ngovernments. The UK economy is an estimated £77\\xa0billion – or 3.4% – smaller \\nbecause of the underperformance of city regions outside the Greater South East.102 \\nThe government’s strategy for regional growth will address this, supporting local \\nleaders to drive growth in city regions and make the most of the opportunities in \\neach part of the country. The government will work in partnership with devolved \\ngovernments to drive economic growth across the country as part of the growth \\nmission.\\n3.28 The government has established the Council of Nations and Regions and \\nCouncil of the Mayors; is working with local areas in England on the upcoming \\nEnglish Devolution White Paper and as they develop Local Growth Plans; and is \\nputting ‘place’ at the heart of Invest 2035: A Modern Industrial Strategy.103\\n3.29 The devolved governments will receive an additional £6.6\\xa0billion through \\nthe operation of the Barnett formula in 2025- 26. This includes £3.4\\xa0billion for the \\nScottish Government, £1.7\\xa0billion for the Welsh Government and £1.5\\xa0billion for the \\nNorthern Ireland Executive.\\n3.30 The Budget delivers the next steps in the government’s approach to regional \\ngrowth, through investment, devolution and reform. On investment, this includes:\\n• Shifting the dial on growth in our great northern cities, including confirming \\ninvestment in the Liverpool Central Docks to deliver up to 2,000 homes and \\ntransform the waterfront. The government is also increasing the City Region \\n102 HMT analysis of ONS Subnational Productivity data 2022 (nominal values).

The government will set out further details in \\ndue course.\\n• Unlocking transformational growth in the Oxford, Milton Keynes and \\nCambridge corridor through £10\\xa0million of funding to enable the Cambridge \\nGrowth Company to develop an ambitious plan for the housing, transport, \\nwater, and wider infrastructure Cambridge needs to realise its full potential, \\nand by taking the next steps to deliver East West Rail. This will support life \\nsciences companies and unlock private investment, cementing Cambridge’s \\nstatus as a globally renowned centre of excellence and its important role within \\nthe Industrial Strategy.\\n• Investing in growth and regeneration projects across the UK. The Budget \\nconfirms funding for the Investment Zones and Freeports programmes \\nUK-wide, including approval of the East Midlands Investment Zone to support \\nadvanced manufacturing and green industries, and the designation of five \\nnew customs sites in existing Freeports. The UK Shared Prosperity Fund will \\ncontinue at a reduced level for a further year with £900\\xa0million of funding; this \\ntransitional arrangement will provide as much stability as possible in advance \\nof wider local growth funding reforms. The Long- Term Plan for Towns will be \\nretained and reformed into a new regeneration programme.\\n• Proceeding with the Mid South West and Causeway Coast and Glens City \\nand Growth Deals. The Budget confirms £162\\xa0million of investment over 15 \\nyears, subject to value for money assessments of business cases, supporting \\neconomic growth in Northern Ireland’s rural regions. The government also \\nconfirms £25\\xa0million for the 10 -year investment in the Argyll and Bute City and \\nGrowth Deal to drive inclusive and sustainable economic growth, subject to \\na value for money assessment on business cases. The government will work \\nwith the devolved governments to agree an appropriate level for this. The \\ngovernment also confirms £80\\xa0million of funding for the Port Talbot Transition \\nBoard, with work already underway to support workers and businesses affected \\nby decarbonisation at Tata Steel.\\n• Confirming £125\\xa0million for Great British Energy, which will be headquartered \\nin Aberdeen. The government has also confirmed support for two electrolytic \\nhydrogen projects in Scotland, in Cromarthy and Whitellee, and two in Wales, \\nin Milford Haven and Bridgend, to support low carbon hydrogen production \\nand directly create good quality, local jobs.\\n• Supporting Scottish trade by providing £0.75\\xa0million to establish Brand \\nScotland, a programme run by the Scotland Office to promote Scottish \\ninvestment opportunities and exports across the globe.\\n• Designating tax sites in Celtic Freeport in South Wales, meaning businesses \\nwill be able to start to benefit from tax reliefs on new investment and \\nemployment in those sites in November, supporting the Freeport to create \\ngood, highly skilled jobs in an area that needs them.69\\nAutumn Budget 20243.31 On devolution, the government is working closely with local leaders on the \\nupcoming English Devolution White Paper, and the Budget introduces the first \\nintegrated settlements for the West Midlands and Greater Manchester from \\n2025- 26. The integrated settlements will deliver a single flexible pot of funding with \\na single outcomes framework to support MCAs to deliver growth. The government \\nwants more regions to benefit from integrated settlements and is confirming the \\nMCAs that are eligible to receive integrated settlements from 2026 -27: the North \\nEast, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authorities, and Liverpool \\nCity Region Combined Authority. The government will also explore how an \\nintegrated settlement could apply to the Greater London Authority from 2026 -27.\\n3.32 The government will reform the local growth funding landscape at Phase \\n2 of the Spending Review: rationalising the number of funds, moving away from \\ncompetitions, and better supporting local leaders to drive growth. The government \\nwill also set out more detail on its strategy for regional growth alongside, and \\nintegrated with, plans for infrastructure, investment, and the Industrial Strategy.\\nHousing\\n3.33 Affordability of housing has fallen drastically, particularly in major cities, as too \\nfew houses have been built, especially in low -affordability areas. Building houses \\nin the right places is vital to long- term economic growth, allowing our towns \\nand cities to grow, and providing the homes people want near good jobs. The \\ngovernment has already taken swift action to kickstart the delivery of 1.5\\xa0million \\nhomes, including: launching the National Planning Policy Framework consultation, \\nthe New Homes Accelerator, and New Towns Taskforce. The government is also \\nseeking views on a ‘brownfield passport’ to ensure that suitable projects get a swift \\nand straightforward approval for development.\\n3.34 The Budget sets out a series of new investments to promote housing market \\nstability and to kickstart the biggest increase to social and affordable housebuilding \\nin a generation. This is an important step to providing the conditions needed for \\nthe market to deliver 1.5\\xa0million homes:\\n• A £500\\xa0million boost to the Affordable Homes Programme to build up to 5,000 \\nadditional affordable homes.\\n• The government will set out details of future grant investment beyond the \\ncurrent Affordable Homes Programme at Phase 2 of the Spending Review, to \\nsupport greater investment in new affordable housing from social housing \\nproviders. Investment will run for at least the duration of this Parliament, and \\nwill support a mix of tenures, with a focus on delivering homes for social rent.\\n• A consultation on a new long- term social housing rent settlement of CPI+1% \\nfor 5 years will offer long- term certainty for social housing providers, giving \\nthe sector the confidence to build tens of thousands of new social homes. The \\ngovernment will consult on whether further potential measures, such as a \\n10-year settlement, could provide more certainty.\\n• Reducing discounts on the Right to Buy scheme and enabling councils \\nin England to keep all the receipts generated by sales will deliver on the \\ngovernment’s manifesto commitment to protect existing council housing \\nstock and boost council capacity to ensure that vital social housing is available \\nto those who need it most.\\n• £3\\xa0billion of additional support for SMEs and the Build to Rent sector, in the \\nform of housing guarantee schemes, to support the private housing market.70\\nAutumn Budget 20243.35 The Budget also supports delivery of tens of thousands of new homes: \\n• Planning : Housing delivery cannot be achieved at the scale the country \\nrequires without reforms to the planning system and ensuring sufficient \\ncapacity exists to support wider economic growth. The government will \\nprovide £46\\xa0million of additional funding to support recruitment and training \\nof 300 graduates and apprentices into local planning authorities, accelerate \\nlarge sites that are stuck in the system, and boost and upskill local planning \\nauthority capacity to deliver the government’s wider reform agenda.\\n• Unblocking delivery of homes : The government is already taking decisive \\naction to get more homes built in order to support growth, including \\nconfirming £56\\xa0million to unlock over 2,000 new homes at Liverpool Central \\nDocks, along with a £25\\xa0million investment in a new joint venture to deliver \\n3,000 energy -efficient new homes across the country, with a target of 100% \\nof these being affordable. The Budget also confirms £47\\xa0million of funding to \\nsupport the delivery of up to 28,000 homes that would otherwise be stalled \\ndue to nutrient neutrality in affected catchments.\\n3.36 The government will be engaging with industry over the autumn on the \\nmortgage guarantee scheme and plans to make it permanently available to \\nsupport lending at 95%, ending the stop-start availability of the scheme and giving \\nlenders confidence throughout the cycle, while making it easier for first -time \\nbuyers to realise the dream of home ownership. The government will bring forward \\nfurther details in Phase 2 of the Spending Review.\\n3.37 The government is committed to improving building safety and accelerating \\nremediation of unsafe housing in response to the Grenfell Tower fire. Investment in \\nremediation will rise to over £1\\xa0billion in 2025- 26. This includes new investment to \\nspeed up remediation of social housing. The government will set out further steps \\non remediation later this autumn.\\nPeople: skills and workforce\\n3.38 Increasing the number of people in good jobs is central to the government’s \\nambition to drive growth. Since the pandemic, economic inactivity has increased \\nand ill-health related inactivity has increased to a record high of 2.8\\xa0million. \\nReducing these levels of inactivity will be important in reaching the bold, long- term \\nambition of an 80% employment rate, which would mean over 2\\xa0million more \\npeople in work today, boosting the economy and public finances.104\\n3.39 To support this long- term ambition, the government introduced the \\nEmployment Rights Bill on 10 October 2024, the first phase of delivering the Plan \\nto Make Work Pay. This legislation will modernise the UK’s employment rights \\nframework in response to the changing world of work, including by making flexible \\nworking the default, establishing a new right to bereavement leave, and making \\npaternity and parental leave available from day 1 of starting a new job.\\n3.40 Through the Budget, the government is providing record levels of capital \\ninvestment in health to deliver capacity for more diagnostic and surgical \\nprocedures and to help reduce the elective waiting list in England, thereby \\nsupporting people into work.\\n104 HMT calculation based on Labour Force survey data for the three months to August 2024 where an employment \\nrate of 80% is multiplied by the UK population aged 16 -64 (42.4\\xa0million) and the actual UK employment level \\n(31.8\\xa0million) is subtracted from this figure. Data: ONS Labour Market Table A01.71\\nAutumn Budget 20243.41 The Budget also provides an additional £1.8\\xa0billion to continue the expansion \\nof government -funded childcare support for working parents in England, bringing \\ntotal spending on childcare to over £8\\xa0billion in 2025- 26. This will support parents, \\nand particularly mothers, to stay in and return to work, with the OBR forecasting \\nthat an additional 60,000 will enter work by 2028.\\n3.42 As part of the Get Britain Working White Paper, which will be published \\nshortly, the government is investing £240\\xa0million to trial new ways of getting \\npeople back into work. The government will test new approaches and collect \\nrobust evidence on how to tackle the root causes of ill-health related inactivity, \\nsupport young people who are ‘not in education, employment or training’ (NEET), \\nand help people to develop their careers.\\n3.43 The Get Britain Working White Paper will:\\n• Establish eight trailblazer areas across England and Wales that bring together \\nhealth, employment, and skills services to improve the support available to \\nthose who are inactive due to ill health and help them return to work. This \\nwill include NHS England Health and Growth Accelerators in at least three \\nIntegrated Care Systems to develop evidence of the impact of targeted action \\non the top health conditions driving economic inactivity.\\n• Establish eight Youth Guarantee Trailblazers areas to test new ways of \\nsupporting young people into employment or training, by bringing together \\nand enhancing existing programmes in partnership with local areas.\\n3.44 The government will invest £115\\xa0million in 2025- 26 to deliver Connect to Work, \\na new supported employment programme matching people with disabilities or \\nhealth conditions into vacancies and supporting them to succeed in their roles. \\nFrom 2026 -27, this will support nearly 100,000 people a year. Local authorities will \\nbe able to tailor their delivery of Connect to Work in ways that meet their local \\nneeds. Greater Manchester and West Midlands Combined Authorities will receive \\neven greater flexibilities, with funding included in their Integrated Settlement.\\n3.45 The government will set out reforms to the health and disability benefits \\nsystem early in 2025 to ensure the system supports people who can work to remain \\nin or start work, in a way that is fair and sustainable. \\n3.46 The government is committed to addressing skills challenges, which are \\nholding back growth across the country, alongside supporting people into work. \\nThe government has already established Skills England to begin addressing \\nthese challenges. In the Budget, the government is going further by providing an \\nadditional £300\\xa0million for further education in England, while increasing the core \\nschools budget by £2.3\\xa0billion, which increases per pupil funding in real terms.\\n3.47 The government will also take steps to transform the Apprenticeship Levy into \\na more flexible Growth and Skills Levy by investing £40\\xa0million, which will help to \\ndeliver new foundation and shorter apprenticeships in key sectors.

It will also look to shape the type of growth \\nbeing pursued: to support Net Zero, regional growth, and secure and resilient \\ngrowth.\\n3.49  The government launched a green paper on its modern Industrial Strategy \\nearlier this month.108 It set out the eight growth- driving sectors (advanced \\nmanufacturing, creative industries, clean energy industries, defence, digital \\nand technologies, financial services, life sciences, and professional and business \\nservices) and announced that the government will produce plans for each sector as \\npart of its commitment to help them thrive.\\n3.50 To help ensure the Industrial Strategy is long term in nature, the government \\nis establishing an Industrial Strategy Advisory Council chaired by Clare Barclay. The \\nCouncil will monitor and advise the government on the delivery of the Strategy, \\nworking closely with business, trade unions, devolved governments, local leaders, \\nacademia, and other stakeholders.\\n3.51 The Budget confirms the Industrial Strategy’s commitment to target \\ninterventions to drive growth where the UK has, or could develop, a comparative \\nadvantage. It prioritises long- term funding for growth- driving sectors ahead of the \\nfull modern Industrial Strategy’s publication next year, including:\\n• £975\\xa0million for the aerospace sector over 5 years to fund vital research and \\ndevelopment for the latest aerospace technology.\\n• Over £2\\xa0billion over 5 years to support the automotive sector including the \\nzero emissions vehicle manufacturing sector and supply chain, providing \\nthe long- term certainty that industry need to invest in advanced, greener \\ntechnologies.\\n• Up to £520\\xa0million for a new Life Sciences Innovative Manufacturing Fund to \\ndrive growth and build resilience for future health emergencies.\\n• Tax reliefs for world-leading creative industries, which will provide £15\\xa0billion of \\nsupport over the next 5 years.\\n• The government will continue to broaden and diversify the talent pipeline in \\nthe creative industries by providing £3\\xa0million to expand the Creative Careers \\nProgramme, giving school children the opportunity to learn more about career \\nroutes and directly engage with the workplace.\\n108 Invest 2035: Industrial Strategy Green Paper, Department for Business and Trade and HM Treasury, October \\n2024. https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/invest-2035-the-uks-modern-industrial-strategy/invest-2035-\\nthe-uks-modern-industrial-strategy .74\\nAutumn Budget 2024• £25\\xa0million funding for the North East Mayoral Combined Authority (NEMCA) \\nhas been confirmed. NEMCA plans to use the funding to remediate the Crown \\nWorks Studio site. This will support the North East’s creative industries and is \\nexpected to lead to around 8,000 new jobs in the region.\\n3.52 Further growth- driving sectors are benefitting from decisions made by the \\ngovernment:\\n• Of the £56.9\\xa0billion defence budget in 2024 -25, around £25\\xa0billion will be \\nspent on UK industry, supporting advanced manufacturing in aircraft, radars, \\nsubmarines, and other key industrial capabilities.\\n• The UK’s clean energy sector will benefit from £3.9\\xa0billion of funding in 2025- 26 \\nfor Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage Track-1 projects to decarbonise industry \\nand contracts with 11\\xa0green hydrogen producers.\\n• The Chancellor will shortly set out her vision for the financial services sector \\nin her Mansion House speech, building on new remit letters to the financial \\nservices regulators which support the growth and competitiveness of the \\nsector, and ensuring we make the most of the talent in the sector through the \\nWomen in Finance Charter.\\n• Further detail on support for the digital and technologies sector is provided in \\nthe Innovation section below.\\n3.53 The Budget also ensures support for these sectors is distributed across the UK. \\nAs noted above, the Investment Zones and Freeports programmes will continue. \\nThe government is announcing the approval of the East Midlands Investment \\nZone, which will use its funding envelope to drive growth in green industries \\nand advanced manufacturing. Funding was also released earlier this month for \\nInvestment Zones supporting advanced manufacturing in the West Midlands and \\nlife sciences in West Yorkshire, supporting major clusters in the Industrial Strategy’s \\ngrowth- driving sectors. In addition, the Cambridge life sciences cluster is being \\nsupported by taking the next steps in delivering East West Rail, to connect the \\nlaboratories, industrial parks, and housing needed.\\n3.54 The Industrial Strategy and sector plans will be published alongside Phase\\xa02 \\nof the Spending Review. To inform them, the government will engage widely \\nthroughout the development of the Strategy and is asking stakeholders to respond \\nto the green paper published earlier this month.\\n3.55 Closely aligned with this work, the government will task the Government \\nChief Scientific Adviser (GCSA), Professor Dame Angela McLean, with the National \\nTechnology Adviser (NTA), Dr Dave Smith, to lead a review on barriers to the \\nadoption of transformative technologies that could enhance innovation and \\nproductivity, with a focus on the growth- driving sectors identified by the Industrial \\nStrategy Green Paper. Reinforcing the government’s growth mission, the review’s \\nrecommendations will directly inform the development of the Industrial Strategy \\nand sector plans.\\nSmall business and entrepreneurship\\n3.56 Thriving small businesses are essential for the growth mission and for \\ncommunities across the UK. The government is committed to supporting \\nbusinesses of all sizes to help them realise their ambitions. 75\\nAutumn Budget 20243.57 The government is committed to making it easier for start -ups and scale -ups \\nto access external sources of financial support. This includes extending the \\nEnterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trust schemes to 2035; \\ncommitting over £250\\xa0million in funding in 2025- 26 for the British Business Bank’s \\nsmall business loans programmes; ensuring small businesses can access UK \\nExport Finance’s support and exploring the need for new products to support \\nsmall exporters to access the insurance and finance they need; and publishing \\npost-implementation reviews of the Bank Referral Scheme and Commercial Credit \\nData Sharing Scheme. The government now intends to consult on enhancing both \\npolicies to better support SME access to finance.\\n3.58 To support more small businesses’ digitisation efforts, the government will \\nextend the SME Digital Adoption Taskforce and it will produce an interim report \\nearly in 2025. The Department for Business and Trade will soon announce details of \\na £4\\xa0million pilots package to encourage tech adoption for SMEs.\\n3.59 The government will also extend the Made Smarter Innovation programme \\nwith up to £37\\xa0million funding in 2025- 26. Funding for the Made Smarter \\nAdoption programme will double to £16\\xa0million in 2025- 26, supporting more small \\nmanufacturing businesses to adopt advanced digital technologies and enabling \\nthe programme to be expanded to all nine English regions. \\n3.60 Late payments can bring cash- flow challenges for small businesses, so from \\n1 October 2025, companies bidding for government contracts over £5\\xa0million per \\nannum will be excluded from the procurement process if they do not pay their \\nown suppliers within an average of 45 days. The government also views increasing \\nits procurement spend with small businesses as an important economic growth \\nlever, with further details on implementing this to be set out in the National \\nProcurement Policy Statement next year.\\n3.61 The government will maintain the Corporation Tax Small Profits Rate and \\nmarginal relief at their current rate and thresholds. This means 9 in 10 actively \\ntrading companies, including a majority of SMEs, will have a Corporation Tax rate \\nlower than 25%. The £1\\xa0million Annual Investment Allowance will also be kept in \\nplace to provide the certainty businesses need to invest. \\n3.62 The government will also commit to funding for two key growth- driving \\nprogrammes in 2025- 26: Growth Hubs in England and Help to Grow: Management \\nacross the UK, which help businesses and entrepreneurs unlock their potential \\nthrough bespoke support and resources.\\n3.63 Looking ahead, the government will bring forward a Small Business Strategy \\nCommand Paper next year, setting out the government’s vision for support for \\nsmall businesses. This will complement the forthcoming Industrial Strategy and \\nTrade Strategy.\\nTrade Strategy\\n3.64 The government will publish a Trade Strategy in 2025. This will renew the UK’s \\ncommitment to free and open trade, support the government’s Industrial Strategy \\nand Net Zero ambitions, and enhance economic security. To support this strategy, \\nthe government will work with the European Union to identify areas where we \\ncan strengthen cooperation for mutual benefit, including the economy, energy, \\nsecurity, and resilience. The government is committed to engaging businesses and \\nstakeholders to support the development of this strategy.76\\nAutumn Budget 20243.65 In developing the Trade Strategy, the government is committed to making \\nuse of every lever available to drive economic growth. Free Trade Agreements \\n(FTAs) are one important lever, and the government has already progressed its \\nFTA negotiations programme by recommencing talks with the Gulf Co operation \\nCouncil.\\n3.66 UK Export Finance (UKEF) will now be able to provide financial support to UK \\ncompanies supplying critical minerals to UK exporters in high- growth sectors such \\nas EV battery production, clean growth, aerospace, and defence, furthering the \\ngovernment’s Net Zero ambitions and building supply chain resilience.\\nInnovation\\n3.67 Supporting scientific breakthroughs and spurring innovation are central \\nto progressing the government’s missions to rebuild Britain and to delivering \\nthe Industrial Strategy. The UK has extraordinary strengths in science and \\ninnovation, however we are not doing enough to capitalise on these strengths. The \\ngovernment will support R&D and the adoption and diffusion of innovation across \\nthe country to drive a sustained increase in productivity and improve citizens’ lives. \\n3.68 The UK’s science base is a crucial national asset. To fully harness its potential \\nand foster a dynamic investment economy, the Budget protects record levels \\nof government R&D investment with £20.4\\xa0billion allocated in 2025- 26. This \\nincludes at least £6.1\\xa0billion of support for core research.109 The government’s R&D \\ninvestment also fully funds Horizon association, meaning that UK researchers \\nand businesses can participate confidently in the world’s largest programme of \\nresearch cooperation, worth more than £80\\xa0billion.\\n3.69 The government will also provide stability and long- term certainty for key R&D \\nactivities through 10 -year budgets, which will create an environment for productive \\nlong- term partnerships with industry. These will be set out as part of Phase 2 of the \\nSpending Review.\\n3.70 The government will ensure these benefits are felt across the country, \\nincluding through Innovation Accelerators, which the government will extend into \\n2025- 26 to continue to bolster high-potential innovation clusters in the Glasgow \\nCity Region, Greater Manchester, and the West Midlands.\\n3.71 Reflecting the importance of R&D to the delivery of the government’s \\nmissions, through the Budget the government is announcing:\\n• At least £25\\xa0million in 2025- 26 to launch a new multi- year R&D Missions \\nProgramme to solve targeted problems that will crowd in private and third \\nsector investment to accelerate delivery of each mission. \\n• A real terms uplift to the budget of the National Institute for Health and Care \\nResearch (NIHR) as part of over £2\\xa0billion of R&D funding, supporting life \\nsciences innovation and accelerating the delivery of the health and growth \\nmissions.\\n• Significant support in 2025- 26 for UK fusion energy research, to build on the \\nUK’s position as a global leader in sustainable nuclear energy.\\n109 Core research for these purposes covers Research England, Research Council, UKRI talent, UKRI international \\nsubscriptions, and National Academies funding. 77\\nAutumn Budget 20243.72 It is critical to the growth mission that our most innovative companies are \\nsupported to start, scale, and grow in the UK. The government is supporting \\ncommercialisation of our world- class university research by providing at least \\n£40\\xa0million over 5 years for proof -of-concept funding and improvements to support \\nfor researchers spinning out the UK’s cutting- edge research into firms of the future. \\nThrough the establishment of the British Growth Partnership and the undertaking \\nof the pensions review, the government is seeking to encourage more investment \\nfrom pension funds into UK growth assets.\\n3.73  Science and innovation are critical to the delivery of the government’s \\nmodern Industrial Strategy. This includes maximising the growth benefits of the \\nUK’s thriving digital and technology sectors. The government:\\n• Will shortly publish the Artificial Intelligence Opportunities Action Plan setting \\nout a roadmap to capture the opportunities of AI to enhance growth and \\nproductivity and better deliver services for the public.\\n• Is creating a National Data Library to unlock the full value of our public data \\nassets. This will provide simple, ethical, and secure access to public data assets, \\ngiving researchers and businesses powerful insights that will drive growth \\nand transform people’s quality of life through better public services and \\ncutting- edge innovation, including AI.\\nNet Zero and Clean Energy\\n3.74 Transitioning to Net Zero and delivering on the government’s clean energy \\nsuperpower mission is central to ensuring sustainable and resilient long- term \\ngrowth. The government will deliver this transition in a way that captures economic \\nopportunities, securing investment and growth in clean energy industries across \\nthe UK.\\n3.75 The government has already taken steps to unblock and drive investment into \\nthe UK’s clean energy industries.\\n• Reversed the de facto ban on onshore wind in England, which will help deliver \\ncheap, reliable, and clean energy across the UK.\\n• Approved four major solar projects of nearly 2GW, enabling the creation of \\nthousands of jobs.\\n• Significantly increased the budget for the sixth Contracts for Difference \\nallocation round, resulting in a record number of contracts.110\\n• Secured £34.8\\xa0billion of private investment into the UK’s clean energy \\nindustries around the International Investment Summit.111\\n3.76 The Budget builds on these first steps and seeks to maximise the growth \\nopportunities of the Net Zero transition and grow UK clean energy industries by:\\n• Providing £3.9\\xa0billion of funding in 2025- 26 for Carbon Capture, Usage and \\nStorage Track-1 projects to decarbonise industry, support flexible power \\ngeneration, and capitalise on the UK’s geographic and technical strengths.\\n110 Contracts for Difference (CfD) Allocation Round 6: Results, Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, 2024.\\n111 https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-breaking-international-investment-summit-secures-63-billion-and-\\nnearly-38000-jobs-for-the-uk .78\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Delivering on the first steps of the clean energy superpower mission, with \\n£125\\xa0million in 2025- 26 for Great British Energy, which will be headquartered in \\nAberdeen.\\n• New nuclear will play an important role in helping the UK achieve energy \\nsecurity and clean power, while securing thousands of good, skilled jobs. \\nThis settlement provides £2.7 billion of funding to continue Sizewell C’s \\ndevelopment through 2025-26.

MHCLG will \\nalso work with partners to ensure the Freeports policy model aligns with the \\nnational Industrial Strategy.    \\n• Unlocking future economic growth through £10\\xa0million of funding to enable \\nthe Cambridge Growth Company to develop an ambitious plan for the \\nhousing, transport, water and wider infrastructure Cambridge needs to realise \\nits full potential and taking the next steps to deliver East West Rail.   \\n• Continuing the UK Shared Prosperity Fund at a reduced level for a transition \\nyear by providing £900\\xa0million for local authorities to invest in local growth, in \\nadvance of wider funding reforms. \\n• Confirming £80\\xa0million of funding for the Port Talbot Transition Board, \\nwith work already underway to support workers and businesses affected by \\ndecarbonisation at Tata Steel.  \\n• Confirming funding for MHCLG’s core Levelling Up Fund projects – providing \\n£1.0\\xa0billion in 2025- 26 to revitalise high streets, town centres and communities. \\nTo ensure investment is focussed on the growth mission, the government is \\nminded to cancel unfunded Levelling Up Culture and Capital Projects, and the \\nWest Midlands culture and inward investment funding, that were announced \\nat Spring Budget 2024, but will consult with potential funding recipients before \\nmaking a final decision. 94\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Extending and deepening English devolution by building mayoral capacity \\nand continuing to work with Mayors and local leaders to deliver the growth \\nmission. In light of this approach, the government is minded to cease funding \\nfor the functions previously delivered by Local Enterprise Partnerships and the \\nBusiness Board Network, and will consult on ending funding for pan-regional \\npartnerships. The government will roll out new Local Growth Plans working \\nwith places to take advantage of their economic potential and foster clusters of \\nwell-paid jobs. \\n• Delivering integrated settlements in Greater Manchester and the West \\nMidlands, giving Mayors meaningful control over funding and improving \\nthe fragmented funding landscape for Mayoral Combined Authorities with a \\nflexible single pot. \\nLocal Government\\nTable 4.10: Local Government\\n£ billion (current prices)Outturn\\n2023-24Baseline\\n2024-25Plans\\n2025-26Average annual real \\nterms growth1 \\n2023-24 to 2025-26\\nResource DEL29.6 12.5 14.3 10.2%\\nCapital DEL 0.0 0.0 0.0 -\\nTotal DEL 9.6 12.5 14.3 10.2%\\n1 The RDEL average annual real terms growth rate has been adjusted to account for Budget Cover Transfers in \\n2023-24 that will be processed in-year in 2025-26, and increased pensions contributions (SCAPE) that commenced \\nin 2024-25.\\n2 The MHCLG Local Government growth rate is adjusted to reflect grant surrendered in 2023-24 in relation to local \\ngovernment business rate retention pilots.\\n4.62 The Local Government (LG) settlement provides total DEL funding of \\n£11.4\\xa0billion in 2024-25, and £14.3 billion in 2025-26. This is equivalent to an annual \\nreal-terms growth rate of 10.2% from 2023-24 to 2025-26. This will support local \\nauthorities to continue delivering the essential services they provide. \\n4.63 The LG DEL budget for 2025-26 will increase to £14.3 billion, which includes \\nan additional £1.3 billion of new grant funding for local authority services including \\nat least £600 million in new grant funding for social care. Together with council \\ntax flexibilities and locally-retained business rates, this will provide a real-terms \\nincrease in total core spending power in 2025-26 of around 3.2%.117 In addition, local \\nauthorities are expected to receive around £1.1 billion of new funding in 2025-26 \\nthrough the implementation of the Extended Producer Responsibility scheme \\nto improve recycling outcomes from January 2025, equivalent to a further c.1.6% \\nreal-terms increase in local government resources.

This guarantee will provide \\nsignificant additional financial certainty for local authorities. The government will \\nalso work to ensure that, as far as practicably possible, local government income \\nis unaffected by business rates tax policy changes and that local government is \\ncompensated for administration costs. \\n117 The underlying figure for core spending power is an estimate and subject to data changes. Final figures will be \\npublished as part of the 2025- 26 Local Government Finance Settlement.95\\nAutumn Budget 20244.64 The government recognises the pressures that local authorities are facing and \\nwill have a framework in place to support those in most difficulty. The government \\nis also committed to pursuing a comprehensive set of reforms to return the sector \\nto a sustainable position. This will include reform of the approach to allocating \\nfunding through the LGFS, starting with a targeted approach to allocating \\nadditional funding in 2025-26, ahead of a broader redistribution of funding through \\na multi-year settlement from 2026-27. The government will set out further details \\nthrough an upcoming local government finance policy statement. \\n4.65 The government is also committed to improving outcomes and reducing \\ncosts in local government services. The government will provide over £250 million \\nto continue testing children’s social care reforms, including new funding to pilot \\na Kinship Allowance and to create thousands of new foster placements. The \\ngovernment will set out plans for fundamental reform of the children’s social \\ncare market in Phase 2, including promoting early intervention to help children \\nstay with their families where possible and fixing the broken care market. The \\ngovernment has also provided a £1 billion increase to SEND and Alternative \\nProvision funding, the second biggest ever year-on-year increase. This is an \\nimportant step in realising the government’s vision to transform England’s SEND \\nsystem to improve outcomes and return local authorities to financial sustainability. \\nThe government will continue to work with key partners and bring forward further \\nplans to deliver this. Furthermore, the government is providing £233 million of \\nadditional spending in 2025-26 to prevent homelessness, taking total spending \\nto £1 billion in 2025-26.

This includes one off additional funding for HS2 to manage inflationary \\npressures, temporary uplifts to local roads maintenance funding and funding for TfL's extraordinary funding \\nsettlement (which ended in March 2024).\\n4.66 The Department for Transport’s (DfT) settlement provides total DEL funding \\nof £30.0 billion in 2025-26. This delivers a £1.2 billion year-on-year cash increase in \\n2025-26. \\n4.67  The audit of public spending in July, identified £3.5 billion of unfunded \\npressures related to transport in 2024-25, and over £800 million unfunded capital \\ncommitments in 2025-26. In response to this, the government cancelled several low \\nvalue and unaffordable programmes, including the A303 Stonehenge tunnel, the \\nA27 schemes, and the Restoring Your Railway programme. 96\\nAutumn Budget 20244.68 Well-targeted transport investment is a key contributor to the government’s \\neconomic growth mission and drives productivity growth by increasing access to \\nlabour markets and unlocking areas for wider development including housing. \\n4.69 The settlement provides increased investment in local roads maintenance \\nand local transport, supporting everyday journeys and addressing poor connectivity \\nwithin our towns and cities across the country, which is currently a key drag on \\ngrowth. It does this by: \\n• Going beyond the government’s promise to fix an additional 1 million potholes \\nper year and providing a £500 million cash increase on 2024-25 local roads \\nmaintenance baseline funding. \\n• Providing an additional £200 million for City Region Sustainable Transport \\nSettlements, bringing local transport spending for Metro Mayors in 2025-26 to \\n£1.3 billion. The government will also work with Mayoral Combined Authorities \\nto increase the ambition on housing investment that accompanies expansion \\nof transport links. \\n• Providing over £650 million of funding for local transport beyond City Region \\nSustainable Transport Settlements in 2025-26 to ensure that transport \\nconnections improve in our towns, villages and rural areas as well as in our \\nmajor cities. This includes funding to progress transport-related Levelling Up \\nFund projects from Rounds 1, 2 and 3. The Transport Secretary will set out \\nfurther detail on how this funding will be allocated in due course. \\n• Providing over £1 billion funding to support local areas and bus operators, \\nin 2025-26, providing high quality bus services across the country. The \\ngovernment is extending the bus fare cap, which was due to end in December \\n2024. A new cap will run from January 2025 to December 2025 at the higher \\nrate of £3. This will allow the government to develop a more sustainable model \\nof government support for the bus sector that is better value for taxpayers and \\nbus passengers. \\n• £485 million for Transport for London (TFL)’s capital renewals programme in \\n2025-26. This includes funding for rolling stock on the Piccadilly and Elizabeth \\nLines. \\n• Providing an additional £100 million investment in cycling and walking \\ninfrastructure in 2025-26, to support Local Authorities to install cycling \\ninfrastructure and upgrade pavements and paths. \\n4.70  The settlement secures delivery and development of growth enhancing \\nmajor transport projects, providing critical connectivity between our biggest \\neconomic centres and supporting the development and delivery of new housing, \\nby: \\n• Committing to East West Rail between Oxford, Milton Keynes and Cambridge, \\nincluding funding to accelerate delivery of the Marston Vale Line ensuring \\nservices will run between Oxford and Bedford from 2030. This scheme will \\nunlock land for housing and laboratories across the region, particularly around \\nCambridge, supporting the world-leading life sciences sector. The government \\nis also launching the consultation for the next stage of East West Rail. 97\\nAutumn Budget 2024• Delivering the Transpennine Route Upgrade between York and Manchester, \\nvia Leeds and Huddersfield, and maintaining momentum on Northern \\nPowerhouse Rail by progressing further planning and design works to support \\nfuture delivery. \\n• Progressing HS2 Phase One to improve connectivity between London \\nand Birmingham and increase capacity on the West Coast Mainline, while \\ndelivering the Transport Secretary’s commitments to control costs and bring \\nthe project back on track. \\n• Confirming funding to tunnel from Old Oak Common to Euston to ensure \\nHS2 trains terminate in central London, catalysing private investment into the \\nstation and local area. \\n• Progressing key strategic road schemes, such as dualling sections of the \\nA47, where work has begun to improve connectivity between East Anglia \\nand the North, and on the A57, where work will start in the coming weeks to \\nimprove journey times between Sheffield and Greater Manchester. Roads \\ninvestment in 2025-26 will be funded through an interim roads settlement, \\nand the third Road Investment Strategy will be set out in the next phase of the \\nSpending Review. The government will also move toward feasibility work on \\nimprovements to the A75 by providing up to £5\\xa0million in 2025- 26.\\n4.71 Transport is key to the government’s clean energy mission. The settlement \\nprovides further support to decarbonise the transport sector by:\\n• Investing over £200 million in 2025-26 to accelerate the rollout of electric \\nvehicle charging infrastructure, including funding to support local authorities \\nto install on-street charge points across England. \\n• Providing £120 million in 2025-26 to support the purchase of new electric \\nvans through the plug-in vehicle grant and to support the manufacture of \\nwheelchair-accessible electric vehicles. \\n• Extending the Advanced Fuels Fund for a further year to support the producers \\nof sustainable aviation fuel. \\n4.72 The settlement will also support the government’s ambition to improve \\nthe performance and reliability of rail services, ensuring the rail sector can \\noperate effectively and become financially sustainable. Since the pandemic, the \\ngovernment subsidy for passenger services has increased to meet a shortfall in \\nrevenue as travel patterns have changed, in addition to the funding it provides to \\noperate and maintain the rail network. The government will look to recover this \\nshortfall to support services and ensure the railway is able to operate effectively. \\nThe government confirms that the annual regulated rail fares cap will rise by 4.6% \\non 2 March 2025, one percentage point above RPI. This will be the lowest absolute \\nincrease in three years. Subject to an industry proposal, the government will also \\nagree a £5 increase to the price of most rail cards (except the disabled person’s \\nrail card). On average rail card holders save up to £158 per year. These policies will \\nsupport the Secretary of State for Transport’s plans for reform, which will increase \\nefficiency and reduce costs, while boosting ridership and revenue and improving \\nperformance, laying the groundwork for the transition to Great British Railways. The \\ngovernment also recognises the value that rail manufacturing brings to the UK and \\nis in the early stages of agreeing a rolling stock strategy that will bring stability to \\nthe sector. 98\\nAutumn Budget 20244.73  As part of the government’s commitment to growth, it will take difficult \\ndecisions where there is not a clear value for money case to invest.

Great British Energy (GBE) will be at the heart of the mission, and \\nto kick-start GBE’s work, the settlement provides £100\\xa0million capital funding \\nin 2025- 26 for clean energy project development. The settlement also provides \\n£25\\xa0million to establish GBE as a company, headquartered in Aberdeen. As GBE \\nis established, the investment activity will be undertaken by the National Wealth \\nFund, helping it to make initial investments as quickly as possible and draw on the \\nNational Wealth Fund’s resources, experience and pipeline of projects. \\n4.76  The settlement provides £3.9\\xa0billion in 2025-26 for the first carbon capture and \\nstorage (CCUS) clusters in the UK. In supporting these projects, the government is \\nequipping industry with the tools they need to kick-start the CCUS and hydrogen \\nindustries, delivering clean energy investment and jobs. \\n4.77 The Warm Homes Plan will transform homes across the country by making \\nthem cleaner and cheaper to run, from installing new insulation to rolling out solar \\nand heat pumps. As the first step towards the Warm Homes Plan, the settlement \\nprovides over £1\\xa0billion next year, and to provide supply chain certainty now, a \\nguarantee of investment of an initial £3.4\\xa0billion towards heat decarbonisation \\nand household energy efficiency between 2025-26 and 2027-28. Further funding 99\\nAutumn Budget 2024over this period will be considered as part of Phase\\xa02 of the Spending Review.

In determining the overall structure of \\nthe financing remit, the government assesses the costs and risks of debt issuance \\nby maturity and type of instrument. Decisions on the composition of debt issuance \\nare also informed by an assessment of investor demand for debt instruments by \\nmaturity and type, as well as the government’s appetite for risk. Alongside these \\nconsiderations, the government takes into account the practical implications of \\nissuance (for example, the scheduling of operations throughout the year).\\nA.4 While decisions on debt management policy must be taken with a long-\\nterm perspective, specific decisions on funding the government’s gross financing \\nrequirement are taken annually. Those decisions are announced in advance of \\nthe forthcoming financial year and are typically updated in April (a technical \\nadjustment to reflect outturn data from the previous year) and, as now, when the \\nOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR) publishes subsequent fiscal projections.\\nFinancing arithmetic\\nA.5 The updated financing arithmetic for 2024-25 is set out in Table A.1.\\nA.6 The OBR’s October 2024 forecast for the 2024-25 central government net cash \\nrequirement (excluding NRAM ltd, Bradford & Bingley, and Network Rail), which is \\nreferred to as CGNCR (ex NRAM, B&B, and NR) is £165.1\\xa0billion, which represents an \\nupward revision of £22.3\\xa0billion since the forecast published at the Spring Budget \\non 6 March 2024. This measure is used in the financing arithmetic, as it reflects the \\nforecast cash requirement of the Exchequer.\\n124 ‘Revision to the DMO’s Financing Remit 2024-25 ’, UK Debt Management Office, April 2024.\\n125 https://www.dmo.gov.uk/ .\\n126 ‘Debt Management Report 2024-25 ’, HM Treasury, March 2024.148\\nAutumn Budget 2024A.7 The DMO’s net financing requirement (NFR) for 2024-25 was revised up \\nby £12.4\\xa0billion on 23 April 2024 from £265.3\\xa0billion at Spring Budget 2024, to \\n£277.7\\xa0billion.

It is \\nanticipated that £236.4\\xa0billion (79.6%) of total gilt sales will take place via auction \\nin 2024-25, and £50.1\\xa0billion (16.9%) will be issued by syndication. The government \\nwill also continue to have the option to schedule gilt tenders, which may be used \\nto assist with delivery of the financing remit and may also be used for market \\nmanagement reasons.\\nGreen gilts and green retail savings products\\nA.12 The government continues to progress with its Green Financing Programme, \\nunder which the UK issues sovereign green bonds (‘green gilts’) via the DMO, \\nand retail Green Savings Bonds (GSBs) via NS&I. As of 29 October 2024, the Green \\nFinancing Programme has raised a total of £43.4\\xa0billion.\\nA.13 The government’s plans to raise £10.0\\xa0billion via issuance of green gilts in \\n2024-25, subject to demand and market conditions, remain unchanged. Total \\ngreen gilt proceeds in the financial year to-date are £5.7\\xa0billion.\\nA.14 The GSBs were brought on sale via the NS&I website on 22 October 2021, and \\nthis product has allowed UK savers to support the government’s green spending \\ninitiatives. NS&I forecast to have raised £1.8\\xa0billion since the initial October 2021 \\nlaunch as of October 2024. NS&I expect additional inflows for 2024-25 to be below \\nthe upper limit of £500\\xa0million, subject to market conditions.\\n127 Includes green gilt issuance.

In the spending \\nframework, spending is broken down into departmental expenditure limits (DEL) \\nand annually managed expenditure (AME). Fixed DEL budgets are set for each \\ndepartment. Spending that is considered difficult to control within fixed budgets \\ndue to its size or volatility is categorised as AME. Budgets are separated into capital, \\nwhich generally equates to spending within public spending gross investment \\n(PSGI) in the national accounts, and resource, generally within public sector current \\nexpenditure (PSCE).\\nC.2 Table C.1 sets out the composition of total managed expenditure (TME) over the \\nforecast period. TME is the totality of public sector spending, DEL and AME, current \\nand capital. The difference between TME and current receipts is public sector net \\nborrowing (PSNB). Table C.1 sets out total current and capital spending and how \\nthis breaks down into resource DEL, resource AME, capital DEL, and capital AME.\\nC.3 Accounting adjustments reconcile DEL and AME budgets with the National \\nAccounts definitions of PSCE, PSGI, and TME. An explanation of these adjustments \\nis provided at Annex D of PESA 2024.\\nC.4 Table C.2 sets out total DEL by department. Tables C.3 and C.4 set out resource \\nand capital DEL by department.\\nC.5 In Tables C.2 and C.3 the 2024-25 resource DEL figures differ from \\ndepartmental budgets shown in table C.6. This is because Tables C.2 and C.3 show \\n2024-25 resource DEL baselines, whereas Table C.6 shows 2024-25 resource DEL \\nbudgets. As usual at spending reviews, baselines are used to represent ongoing \\nspend, with one-off or time limited spend removed, so 2024-25 figures are \\nconsistent with 2025-26. Also as usual, real growth figures are calculated using GDP \\ndeflators consistent with the OBR’s latest forecast.\\nC.6 A proportion of resource DEL, in particular depreciation, is not currently used \\nin measurement of the fiscal aggregates by the ONS and so does not directly \\nimpact on the government’s fiscal rules. Tables C.2, C.3, and C.6 therefore exclude \\ndepreciation.\\nC.7 Financial transactions are a part of departmental capital DEL budgets.

When p = d + 1 − s the proof relies on the Cayley trick, a trick which associates to X a quasi-smooth hypersurface Y in a projective vector bundle, and the Cayley Proposition (4.3) which gives an isomorphism of some primitive cohomologies (4.2) of X and Y . The Cayley trick, following the philosophy of Mavlyutov in [7], reduces results known for quasi-smooth hypersurfaces to quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties. The idea in this paper goes the other way around, we translate some results for quasi-smooth intersection subvarieties to quasi-smooth hypersurfaces, mainly the (1, 1)-Lefschetz theorem.\\n\\nAcknowledgement.

NR = σ1 ∪ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∪ σt.\\n\\nA rational simplicial complete d-dimensional fan Σ deﬁnes a d-dimensional toric variety Σ having only orbifold singularities which we assume to be projective. Moreover, T ∶= Pd N ⊗Z C∗ ≃ (C∗)d is the torus action on Pd Σ. We denote by Σ(i) the i-dimensional cones\\n\\n2\\n\\nof Σ and each ρ ∈ Σ corresponds to an irreducible T -invariant Weil divisor Dρ on Pd Cl(Σ) be the group of Weil divisors on Pd\\n\\nΣ.

The irrelevant ideal of Pd the zero locus Z(Σ) ∶= V(BΣ) in the aﬃne space Ad ∶= Spec(S) is the irrelevant locus.\\n\\nProposition 2.3 (Theorem 5.1.11 [5]). The toric variety Pd Σ is a categorical quotient Ad ∖ Z(Σ) by the group Hom(Cl(Σ), C∗) and the group action is induced by the Cl(Σ)- grading of S.\\n\\n2.2 Orbifolds\\n\\nNow we give a brief introduction to complex orbifolds and we mention the needed theorems for the next section. Namely: de Rham theorem and Dolbeault theorem for complex orbifolds.\\n\\nDeﬁnition 2.4. A complex orbifold of complex dimension d is a singular complex space whose singularities are locally isomorphic to quotient singularities Cd/G, for ﬁnite sub- groups G ⊂ Gl(d, C).\\n\\nDeﬁnition 2.5. A diﬀerential form on a complex orbifold Z is deﬁned locally at z ∈ Z as a G-invariant diﬀerential form on Cd where G ⊂ Gl(d, C) and Z is locally isomorphic to Cd/G around z.\\n\\nRoughly speaking the local geometry of orbifolds reduces to local G-invariant geometry. We have a complex of diﬀerential forms (A●(Z), d) and a double complex (A●,●(Z), ∂, ¯∂) of bigraded diﬀerential forms which deﬁne the de Rham and the Dolbeault cohomology groups (for a ﬁxed p ∈ N) respectively:\\n\\nker ¯∂ im ¯∂\\n\\nker d im d\\n\\nand H p,●(Z, ¯∂) ∶=\\n\\ndR(Z, C) ∶=\\n\\nH ●\\n\\nTheorem 2.6 (Theorem 3.4.4 in [4] and Theorem 1.2 in [1] ).

A subvariety X ⊂ Pd Z(Σ).\\n\\nΣ is quasi-smooth if V(IX ) ⊂ A#Σ(1) is smooth outside\\n\\nExample 3.2. Quasi-smooth hypersurfaces or more generally quasi-smooth intersection sub- varieties are quasi-smooth subvarieties (see [2] or [7] for more details).\\n\\n△\\n\\nRemark 3.3. Quasi-smooth subvarieties are suborbifolds of Pd Σ in the sense of Satake in [8]. Intuitively speaking they are subvarieties whose only singularities come from the ambient space.\\n\\n△\\n\\nTheorem 3.4.

If the dimension of X is 1, 2 or 3. The Hodge conjecture holds on X.\\n\\nProof. If the dimCX = 1 the result is clear by the Hard Lefschetz theorem for projective orbifolds. The dimension 2 and 3 cases are covered by Theorem 3.5 and the Hard Lefschetz. theorem.\\n\\n4 Cayley trick and Cayley proposition\\n\\nThe Cayley trick is a way to associate to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety a quasi- smooth hypersurface. Let L1, . . . , Ls be line bundles on Pd Σ be the projective space bundle associated to the vector bundle E = L1 ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ Ls. It is known that P(E) is a (d + s − 1)-dimensional simplicial toric variety whose fan depends on the degrees of the line bundles and the fan Σ. Furthermore, if the Cox ring, without considering the grading, of Pd\\n\\nΣ and let π ∶ P(E) → Pd\\n\\nΣ is C[x1, . . . , xm] then the Cox ring of P(E) is\\n\\nC[x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , ys]\\n\\nMoreover for X a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety cut oﬀ by f1, . . . , fs with deg(fi) = [Li] we relate the hypersurface Y cut oﬀ by F = y1f1 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + ysfs which turns out to be quasi-smooth. For more details see Section 2 in [7].\\n\\n5\\n\\nWe will denote P(E) as Pd+s−1\\n\\nΣ,X to keep track of its relation with X and Pd Σ.\\n\\nThe following is a key remark.\\n\\nRemark 4.1. There is a morphism ι ∶ X → Y ⊂ Pd+s−1 with y ≠ 0 has a preimage. Hence for any subvariety W = V(IW ) ⊂ X ⊂ Pd W ′ ⊂ Y ⊂ Pd+s−1 Σ,X such that π(W ′) = W , i.e., W ′ = {z = (x, y) ∣ x ∈ W }.\\n\\nΣ,X . Moreover every point z ∶= (x, y) ∈ Y Σ there exists\\n\\n△\\n\\nFor X ⊂ Pd\\n\\nΣ a quasi-smooth intersection variety the morphism in cohomology induced\\n\\nΣ, C) → H d−s(X, C) is injective by Proposition 1.4 in [7].\\n\\nby the inclusion i∗ ∶ H d−s(Pd\\n\\nDeﬁnition 4.2. The primitive cohomology of H d−s and H d−s prim(X, Q) with rational coeﬃcients.\\n\\nprim(X) is the quotient H d−s(X, C)/i∗(H d−s(Pd\\n\\nΣ, C))\\n\\nH d−s(Pd\\n\\nΣ, C) and H d−s(X, C) have pure Hodge structures, and the morphism i∗ is com-\\n\\npatible with them, so that H d−s\\n\\nprim(X) gets a pure Hodge structure.\\n\\nThe next Proposition is the Cayley proposition.\\n\\nProposition 4.3. [Proposition 2.3 in [3] ] Let X = X1 ∩⋅ ⋅ ⋅∩Xs be a quasi-smooth intersec- , d+s−3 tion subvariety in Pd 2\\n\\nΣ cut oﬀ by homogeneous polynomials f1 . . . fs.

If d + s = 2(k + 1),\\n\\nH k+1−s,k+1−s\\n\\n(X) ≃ H k,k\\n\\nprim(Y )\\n\\nprim\\n\\nRemark 4.5. The above isomorphisms are also true with rational coeﬃcients since H ●(X, C) = H ●(X, Q) ⊗Q C. See the beginning of Section 7.1 in [10] for more details.\\n\\n△\\n\\n5 Main result\\n\\nTheorem 5.1. Let Y = {F = y1f1 + ⋯ + ykfk = 0} ⊂ P2k+1 associated to the quasi-smooth intersection surface X = Xf1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ Xfk ⊂ Pk+2 the Hodge conjecture holds.\\n\\nΣ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface Σ . Then on Y\\n\\nProof. If H k,k proposition H k,k\\n\\nprim(X, Q) = 0 we are done. So let us assume H k,k\\n\\nprim(X, Q) ≠ 0. By the Cayley prim(X, Q) and by the (1, 1)-Lefschetz theorem for projective\\n\\nprim(Y, Q) ≃ H 1,1\\n\\n6\\n\\ntoric orbifolds there is a non-zero algebraic basis λC1, . . . , λCn with rational coeﬃcients of H 1,1 prim(X, Q) algebraic curves C1, . . . , Cn in X such that under the Poincar´e duality the class in homology [Ci] goes to λCi, [Ci] ↦ λCi. Recall that the Cox ring of Pk+2 is contained in the Cox ring of P2k+1 Σ,X without considering the Σ ) then (α, 0) ∈ Cl(P2k+1 grading. Considering the grading we have that if α ∈ Cl(Pk+2 Σ,X ). So the polynomials deﬁning Ci ⊂ Pk+2 X,Σ but with diﬀerent degree. Moreover, by Remark 4.1 each Ci is contained in Y = {F = y1f1 + ⋯ + ykfk = 0} and furthermore it has codimension k.\\n\\nprim(X, Q), that is, there are n ∶= h1,1\\n\\ncan be interpreted in P2k+1\\n\\nΣ\\n\\ni=1 is a basis of H k,k It is enough to prove that λCi is diﬀerent from zero in H k,k prim(Y, Q) or equivalently that the cohomology classes {λCi}n i=1 do not come from the ambient space. By contradiction, let us assume that there exists a j and C ⊂ P2k+1 Σ,X , Q) with i∗(λC) = λCj or in terms of homology there exists a (k + 2)-dimensional algebraic subvariety V ⊂ P2k+1 Σ,X such that V ∩ Y = Cj so they are equal as a homology class of P2k+1 Σ,X ,i.e., [V ∩ Y ] = [Cj] . Σ where π ∶ (x, y) ↦ x. Hence It is easy to check that π(V ) ∩ X = Cj as a subvariety of Pk+2 [π(V ) ∩ X] = [Cj] which is equivalent to say that λCj comes from Pk+2 Σ which contradicts the choice of [Cj].\\n\\nClaim: {λCi}n\\n\\nprim(Y, Q).\\n\\nΣ,X such that λC ∈ H k,k(P2k+1\\n\\nRemark 5.2. Into the proof of the previous theorem, the key fact was that on X the Hodge conjecture holds and we translate it to Y by contradiction. So, using an analogous argument we have:\\n\\n△\\n\\nProposition 5.3. Let Y = {F = y1fs+⋯+ysfs = 0} ⊂ P2k+1 associated to a quasi-smooth intersection subvariety X = Xf1 ∩ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ ∩ Xfs ⊂ Pd d + s = 2(k + 1). If the Hodge conjecture holds on X then it holds as well on Y .\\n\\nΣ,X be the quasi-smooth hypersurface Σ such that\\n\\nCorollary 5.4. If the dimension of Y is 2s − 1, 2s or 2s + 1 then the Hodge conjecture holds on Y .\\n\\nProof. By Proposition 5.3 and Corollary 3.6.\\n\\n7\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1] Angella, D.

The paper introduces the Transformer, a model architecture that relies entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output, instead of using recurrence. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. Additionally, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.'"
